We continue discussing problem set $10$.

\subsection{Concept Review}
Here we go.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some sentences are ambiguous. For example, ``There is no largest integer divisible by $3$'' has two different readings, as follows.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There is no largest integer, which happens to be divisible by $3$.
		\item Among the integers divisible by $3$, there is no largest.
	\end{itemize}
	If this concerns you on the problem set, just mark it.
	\item Prenex form of a formula requires that all quantifiers appear in the front. For example, $\forall x\exists yP(x,y)$ is in prenex normal form.
\end{itemize}
