Here we go.

\subsection{Weil Sheaves}
We would like to generalize our sheaves somewhat. Note that we had an action of the geometric Frobenius element on $X_{\ov k}$ from the start. In particular, our \'etale sheaves have a full action by $\pi_1(X,\ov x)$, but we really only need to know about Frobenius action.
\begin{definition}[Weil group]
	Fix a finite field $k\coloneqq\FF_q$. The \textit{Weil group} $W(\ov k/k)$ is the cyclic group generated by the Frobenius.
\end{definition}
Now, note $W(\ov k/k)$ acts on $X_{\ov k}=X\times_k\ov k$, so any \'etale sheaf $\mc G$ on $X$ gains an action of $W(\ov k/k)$ after base-changing to $X_{\ov k}$. Because this sheaf comes from $X$, it should be $W(\ov k/k)$-equivariant, which amounts to providing the data of an isomorphism $F_{X_{\ov k}}^*\mc G\to\mc G$. We are now ready to make the following definition, which generalizes our \'etale sheaves.
\begin{definition}[Weil sheaf]
	A \textit{Weil sheaf} $\mc G_0$ on $X$ consists is a $\ov\QQ_\ell$-sheaf $\mc G$ on $X_{\ov k}$ together with an isomorphism $F^*\colon F^*_{X_{\ov k}}\mc G\to\mc G$. This Weil sheaf $\mc G_0$ is \textit{smooth of rank $r$} if and only if the same is true of $\mc G$ on $X_{\ov k}$.
\end{definition}
Notably, this Weil sheaf is not required to actually come from a sheaf on $X$! (This is the whole point!) This extra flexibility of not having to actually come from a scheme over $\FF_q$ will be helpful for us later.

Let's give a few remarks about the category of Weil sheaves.
\begin{remark}
	The category of Weil sheaves on $X$ form an abelian category. This category contains the category of \'etale sheaves on $X$, embedded as described above.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	If $k'\subseteq\ov k$ is a finite extension of $k$, then the category of Weil sheaves on $X_{k'}$ is the same as the category of Weil sheaves on $X$. Namely, restriction of scalars from $X_{k'}$ to $X$ defines the required equivalence.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	The category of Weil sheaves has the six operations (e.g., pullbacks, derived direct images, and direct image with compact support). The point is that one can do these operations on $X_{\ov k}$, and then one just needs to carry around the extra data of the isomorphism $F^*$.
\end{remark}
We now remark that a Weil sheaf $\mc G_0$ on $X$ is still going to come with an isomorphism $F\colon\mathrm H^i_c(X_{\ov k},\mc G)\to\mathrm H^i_c(X_{\ov k},\mc G)$, so one can define $L(X,\mc G;T)$ as before. There is still a cohomological interpretation, but we will omit its proof.

These Weil sheaves appear to form a Tannakian category, so we are allowed to ask for the corresponding reductive group. To see this, we recall that the short exact sequence
\[1\to\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute et}}(X_{\ov k},\ov x)\to\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute et}}(X,\ov x)\to\op{Gal}(\ov k/k)\to1.\]
The inverse image of $W(\ov k/k)\subseteq\op{Gal}(\ov k/k)$ is some Weil group $W(X,\ov x)\subseteq\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute et}}(X,\ov x)$. It turns out that the induced quotient $W(X,\ov x)/\pi_1(X_{\ov k},\ov x)$ is $W(\ov k/k)\cong\ZZ$. We are now ready to compare these Tannakian categories.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Recall that the category of \'etale sheaves is equivalent to the category of continuous representations of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute et}}(X,\ov x)$ on vector spaces over $\ov\QQ_\ell$.
	\item This then restricts to an equivalence between the category of smooth \'etale sheaves and the category of finite-dimensional continuous representations of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute et}}(X,\ov x)$.
	\item However, the category of Weil sheaves can be seen as the category of continuous representations of $W(X,\ov x)$ of $\ov\QQ_\ell$-vector spaces. To see this, we note that we are essentially removing some data from being a sheaf over $\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute et}}(X,\ov x)$.

	The adjective of smoothness adds a finite-dimensional requirement.
\end{itemize}
