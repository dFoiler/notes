There are no questions.

\subsection{Totally Bounded for Function Spaces}
We continue our discussion of compactness in metric spaces. Fix a topological space $(X,\mc T)$ and a metric space $(M,d)$ so that we can give the space of bounded continuous functions $B_c(X,M)$ the uniform metric $d_u$ by \autoref{prop:contiscomplete}. We would like to understand the compact subset of $B_c(X,M)$, so \autoref{cor:metric-compact} tells us that we are really interested in totally bounded subsets, and we'll take the closure afterward to get our compact sets.

Here are a few lemmas.
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:tot-bound-is-pointwise}
	Fix a topological space $(X,\mc T)$ and a metric space $(M,d)$ so that we can give the space of bounded continuous functions $B_c(X,M)$ the uniform metric $d_u$. Fixing a totally bounded subset $\mc F\subseteq B_c(X,M)$, the set
	\[\{s(x):s\in \mc F\}\]
	totally bounded for any fixed $x\in X$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	For any $\varepsilon>0$ has a finite set $\{f_1,\ldots,f_n\}\subseteq \mc F$ so that $\mc F$ is covered by the $B(s_i,\varepsilon)$. This is equivalent to saying that any $f\in \mc F$ has some $f_i$ with
	\begin{equation}
		d(f(x),f_i(x))\le\varepsilon/2 \label{eq:use-uniform-metric}
	\end{equation}
	for all $x\in X$, so
	\[\{f(x):s\in \mc F\}\subseteq\bigcup_{i=1}^nB(f_i(x),\varepsilon),\]
	by \autoref{eq:use-uniform-metric}, which finishes.
\end{proof}
\autoref{lem:tot-bound-is-pointwise} motivates the following definition.
\begin{definition}[Pointwise totally bounded]
	Fix topological spaces $(X,\mc T_X)$ and a metric space $(M,d)$, and let $\mc F$ be a family of continuous functions $f\colon X\to M$. Then $\mc F$ is \textit{pointwise totally bounded} if and only if any $x\in \mc F$ makes the set
	\[\{f(x):f\in\mc F\}\]
	totally bounded.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	By \autoref{lem:tot-bound-is-equicont}, any totally bounded subset of $B_c(X,M)$ is pointwise totally bounded.
\end{example}
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:tot-bound-is-equicont}
	Fix a topological space $(X,\mc T)$ and a metric space $(M,d)$ so that we can give the space of bounded continuous functions $B_c(X,M)$ the uniform metric $d_u$. Fixing a totally bounded subset $\mc F\subseteq B_c(X,M)$ and a point $x\in X$, any $\varepsilon>0$ has some open subset $U\subseteq X$ containing $x$ such that
	\[d(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon\]
	for any $y\in X$ and $f\in \mc F$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	For any $f\in \mc F$, find some $f_i$ with $d(f_i,f)<\varepsilon/3$, we see that any $y\in \mc F$ can write
	\[d(f(x),f(y))\le d(f(x),f_i(x))+d(f_i(x),f_i(y))+d(f_i(y),f(y))\le2\varepsilon/3+d(f_i(x),f_i(y)).\]
	Now, by the continuity of $f_i$, we see that there is an open subset $U_i$ containing $x$ such that $y\in U_j$ implies $d(f_i(x),f_i(y))<\varepsilon/3$, so $d(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon$ follows.

	We now let $f$ vary, which allows the $U_i$ to vary. Thus, taking the intersection of all the $U_i$ gives us an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that each $y\in U$ has $d(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon$ for any (!) $f\in \mc F$.
\end{proof}
\autoref{lem:tot-bound-is-equicont} motivates the following definition.
\begin{definition}[Equicontinuous]
	Fix topological spaces $(X,\mc T_X)$ and a metric space $(M,d)$, and let $\mc F$ be a family of continuous functions $f\colon X\to M$. We say that the family $\mc F$ is \textit{equicontinuous} at some $x\in X$ if and only if any $\varepsilon>0$ has some open subset $U\subseteq X$ such that $y\in U$ has
	\[d(f(y),f(x))<\varepsilon\]
	for all $f\in \mc F$. The entire family $\mc F$ is \textit{equicontinuous} if any only if it is equicontinuous at all $x\in X$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	By \autoref{lem:tot-bound-is-equicont}, any totally bounded subset of $B_c(X,M)$ is equicontinuous.
\end{example}

\subsection{Arzel\'a--Ascoli's Theorem}
We might hope for a converse of our given lemmas. Here is the result.
\begin{theorem}[Arzel\'a--Ascoli]
	Fix a compact
	 topological space $(X,\mc T)$ and a metric space $(M,d)$ so that we can give the space of bounded continuous functions $B_c(X,M)$ the uniform metric $d_u$. Then any equicontinuous and pointwise totally bounded family $\mc F\subseteq B_c(X,M)$ is totally bounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Fix some $\varepsilon>0$ so that we want to cover $\mc F$ with finitely balls of radius $\varepsilon>0$.
	
	The point is to use compactness on the equicontinuous statement. Indeed, for any $x\in X$, we are promised an open subset $U_x\subseteq X$ such that any $y\in U_x$ and $f\in\mc F$ has $d(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon/4$. However, this means
	\[X\subseteq\bigcup_{x\in X}U_x\]
	gives us an open cover of $X$, so compactness tells us that there is some finite sequence of points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ such that the $U_i\coloneqq U_{x_i}$ cover $X$.

	Now, fixing any particular $i$, we use the pointwise totally bounded condition to note
	\[\{f(x_i):f\in\mc F\}\]
	is totally bounded, so we get a finite subset $S_i\subseteq\mc F$ such that
	\[\{f(x_i):f\in\mc F\}\subseteq\bigcup_{f\in S_i}B(f(x_i),\varepsilon/4).\]
	We now define $S$ as the union of all the $S_i$, which is finite as the finite union of finite sets.

	To finish the proof, we will need to do a little bookkeeping. Let $\Psi$ denote the set of functions from $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ to $S$ so that we can set
	\[\mc F_\psi\coloneqq\{f\in\mc F:f(x_i)\in B(\psi(i),\varepsilon/4)\}\]
	for any $\psi\in\Psi$. By construction, the $\mc F_\psi$ cover $\mc F$, so we will finish upon showing that $\mc F_\psi$ has diameter less than $\varepsilon$. We will show this next class.
\end{proof}
