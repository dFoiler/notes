\section{January 30}

Today we began by completing the proof of the functional equation. I have directly edited into last class's notes for continuity reasons.

% \subsection{The Functional Equation}
% The functional equation will be derived from the functional equation for the $\Theta\colon\CC\to\CC$ function, defined by
% \[\Theta(x)\coloneqq\sum_{n\in\ZZ}e^{-\pi n^2x}.\]
% In particular, \Cref{thm:ps} implies
% \[\Theta(x)=\sum_{n\in\ZZ}e^{-\pi n^2x}=\sum_{n\in\ZZ}e^{-\pi\left(n\sqrt x\right)^2}=\sum_{n\in\ZZ}\frac1{\sqrt x}e^{-\pi\left(n/\sqrt x\right)^2}=\frac1{\sqrt x}\Theta\left(\frac1x\right)\]
% for $x>0$. The uniqueness of analytic continuation now implies $\Theta(z)=\frac1{\sqrt z}\Theta(z)$ for all $z\in\CC$.
% \begin{remark}
% 	For $z\in\HH$, we note that $\Theta(z+2)=\Theta(z)$ and $\Theta(-1/z)=\sqrt{z/i}\cdot\Theta(z)$, which shows that $\Theta$ is a modular form of weight $1/2$ and level
% 	\[\left\langle\begin{bmatrix}
% 		1 & 2 \\
% 		0 & 1
% 	\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}
% 		0 & 1 \\
% 		-1 & 0
% 	\end{bmatrix}\right\rangle.\]
% \end{remark}
% We now use $\Theta$ for fun and profit. Consider the integral
% \[\int_0^\infty\left(\frac{\Theta(x)-1}2\right)x^{s/2}\,\frac{dx}x.\]
% This will converge absolutely for $\op{Re}s>1$. However, for $\op{Re}s>1$, we can unwind this expression as
% \begin{align*}
% 	\int_0^\infty\left(\frac{\Theta(x)-1}2\right)x^{s/2}\,\frac{dx}x &= \int_0^\infty\Bigg(\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\pi n^2x}x^{s/2}\Bigg)\frac{dx}x \\
% 	&= \zeta(s)\int_0^\infty e^{-\pi x}x^{s/2}\,\frac{dx}x \\
% 	&= \zeta(s)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)
% \end{align*}
% after enough rearranging. (Note we interchanged the sum and integral validly because everything absolutely converges.) Now, we define
% \[\xi(s)\coloneqq\zeta(s)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2).\]
% The key result is as follows.
% \begin{theorem}
% 	The function $\Xi(s)\coloneqq\xi(s)s(1-s)$ has an analytic continuation to all of $\CC$ and satisfies the functional equation
% 	\[\xi(s)=\xi(1-s).\]
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
% 	The trick is to break the integral
% 	\[\int_0^\infty\left(\frac{\Theta(x)-1}2\right)x^{s/2}\,\frac{dx}x\]
% 	into pieces $(0,1)$ and $(1,\infty)$.
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item On $(1,\infty)$, we see
% 		\[I(s)\coloneqq\int_1^\infty\left(\frac{\Theta(x)-1}2\right)dx\]
% 		converges absolutely to a holomorphic function.
% 		\item We deal with $(0,1)$. Here,
% 		\[\int_0^1\frac{x^{s/2}}2\,\frac{dx}x=\frac1s,\]
% 		and for the $\Theta$ term, we use modularity to write
% 		\begin{align*}
% 			\int_0^1\left(\frac{\Theta(x)}2\right)x^{s/2}\,\frac{dx}x &= \int_0^1\left(\frac{\Theta(1/x)}{2\sqrt x}\right)x^{s/2}\,\frac{dx}x \\
% 			&= \int_1^\infty\left(\frac{\Theta(x)}2\right)x^{(1-s)/2}\,\frac{dx}x \\
% 			&= I(1-s)-\frac1{1-s}.
% 		\end{align*}
% 		Summing our two pieces, we get $I(1-s)-\frac1s-\frac1{1-s}$.
% 	\end{itemize}
% 	In total, we see
% 	\[\xi(s)=I(s)+I(1-s)-\frac1s-\frac1{1-s},\]
% 	where $I(s)$ is holomorphic. This completes the proof.
% \end{proof}

\subsection{Counting Zeroes of \texorpdfstring{$\zeta$}{ Zeta}}
We would like to understand the (nontrivial) zeroes of $\zeta(s)$, for which we use Cauchy's formula. Roughly speaking, we will study integrals
\[\frac1{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\,ds,\]
where $\gamma$ is a contour over a very tall vertical strip in $\CC$.

It will be convenient to work with the more symmetric (and entire) function $\Xi$ instead of $\zeta$. Let's justify this.
\begin{lemma}
	We have an equality of multisets
	\[\{s\in\CC:\Xi(s)=0\}=\{s\in\CC:\zeta(s)=0\text{ and }0\le\op{Re}s\le1\}.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Recall that $\Xi(s)=s(1-s)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\zeta(s)$. We now show our two inclusions.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $\zeta(s)=0$ and $0\le\op{Re}s\le1$, then we $s\ne1$ (because $\zeta(s)$ has a pole there by \Cref{prop:continue-zeta}) and $s\ne0$ by \Cref{ex:zeta-zero}, and we note $\pi^{-s/2}\ne0$. Thus, $s\ne0$, so $\Gamma(s/2)\ne0$ by \Cref{cor:continue-gamma} as well, so the order of vanishing of $\zeta$ at $s$ equals the order of vanishing of $\Xi$ at $s$.
		\item If $\Xi(s)=0$, then one of the factors must vanish. For $s=0$, we see $\Gamma(s/2)$ has a simple pole by \Cref{cor:continue-gamma} cancelling out the zero. For $s=1$, we see $\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole by \Cref{prop:continue-zeta} cancelling out the zero. Further, $\Gamma(s/2)$ has no zeroes at all by \Cref{rem:recip-gamma-entire}. Thus, we see we must have $\zeta(s)=0$, and in fact $s$ cannot be a trivial zero because $\Gamma(s/2)$ has simple poles there to cancel out those zeroes by \Cref{cor:continue-gamma}.
		
		So $s$ must be in the critical strip, where we note that all the other terms fail to vanish (in particular, $\Gamma$ fails to vanish by \Cref{rem:recip-gamma-entire}), so the order of vanishing of $\Xi$ at $s$ is equal to the order of vanishing of $\zeta$ at $s$.
		\qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
Quickly, we give a pretty basic bound on the number of zeroes from \Cref{prop:bound-zeroes-finite-order}.
\begin{lemma}
	The order of $\Xi$ is less than or equal to $1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Because $\Xi(s)=\Xi(1-s)$, we will focus on the region $\op{Re}s\ge1/2$. Recalling that $\Xi(s)=s(1-s)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\zeta(s)$, we will simply compute the orders of these terms one at a time.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The order of $s(1-s)$ is $0$ by \Cref{ex:poly-order}.
		\item We note
		\[\left|\pi^{-s/2}\right|=\left|e^{-s(\log\pi)/2}\right|=e^{-\op{Re}(s)(\log\pi)/2}.\]
		In particular, $\op{Re}s>0$ implies that this term is less than or equal to $1$ and hence bounded by a polynomial and hence order $0$ by \Cref{ex:poly-order} again.
		\item For $\op{Re}s>1/2$, we note that $|\arg s|<\pi/2$, so we can apply \Cref{prop:stirling}. In particular, we note that
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{|s|\to\infty}\left|\frac{\Gamma(s)}{s^s}\right| &= \exp\left(\left|\lim_{|s|\to\infty}\frac{\log\Gamma(s)}{s\log s}\right|\right) \\
			&= \exp\left(\lim_{|s|\to\infty}\frac{\left(s-\frac12\right)\log s-s+\frac12\log2\pi+O(1/|s|)}{s\log s}\right) \\
			&= \exp\left(\left|1+\lim_{|s|\to\infty}\frac{\left(-\frac12\right)\log s-s+\frac12\log2\pi+O(1/|s|)}{s\log s}\right|\right) \\
			&= \exp(1).
		\end{align*}
		Thus, $\left|\Gamma(s)/s^s\right|$, which is continuous in our region with $\op{Re}s>1/2$, is a bounded function.
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

% We will want the following bounds.
% \begin{lemma}[Stirling]
% 	We have
% 	\[\log\Gamma(s)=\left(s-\frac12\right)\log s+\frac12\log2\pi+O_\delta(1/|s|),\]
% 	and
% 	\[\frac{\Gamma'(s)}{\Gamma(s)}=\log s+O_\delta(1/|s|)\]
% 	as $|s|\to\infty$ for $-\pi+\delta<\arg s<\pi-\delta$.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% 	Omitted.
% \end{proof}
% \begin{remark}
% 	For $\sigma\in[a,b]$ for some fixed $a<b$, we have $\Gamma(\sigma+it)\sim e^{-\pi|t|/2}|t|^{\sigma-1/2}$ as $\to\infty$. Again, we omit this proof.
% \end{remark}
% We also want access to the Hadamard factorization theorem.
% \begin{theorem}
% 	Fix an entire function $\varphi\colon\CC\to\CC$. Let $n(r)$ denote the number of zeroes $z$ such that $|z|<r$ and $\alpha$ the order of an entire function $\varphi$, one has $n(R)=O_\varepsilon\left(R^{\alpha+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon>0$.
% \end{theorem}
Notably, for $\op{Re}s>1/2$, one has $|s(s-1)\zeta(s)|\ll|s|^3$. Further, one can check that $\Gamma$ has order $1$ as an entire function, so $s(1-s)\xi(s)$ has order at most $1$. Thus, Hadamard's factorization theorem enforces
\[s(1-s)\xi(s)=e^{A+Bs}\prod_{\zeta(\rho)=0}\left(\left(1-\frac s\rho\right)e^{s/\rho}\right).\]
Notably, this product will converge absolutely. For example, absolute convergence tells us
\[\sum_{\zeta(\rho)=0}\frac1{|\rho|^{1+\varepsilon}}<\infty\]
for any $\varepsilon>0$. One also has the following result on the distribution of our $\rho$.
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:num-zeroes-zeta}
	Define
	\[N(T)\coloneqq\#\{\rho:0\le\op{Re}\rho\le1,\op{Im}\rho\ge0\zeta(\rho)=0\}.\]
	Then
	\[N(T)=\frac T{2\pi}\log\left(\frac T{2\pi}\right)-\frac T{2\pi}+O(\log T)\]
	as $T\to\infty$.
\end{theorem}
We will first show the following lemma.
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:bound-zeroes}
	We have
	\[\sum_\rho\frac1{1+|\op{Im}\rho-T|^2}\ll\log(T+3).\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	This is by smoothing. By taking logarithmic differentiation
	\[\frac{\Xi'(s)}{\Xi(s)}=B+\sum_\rho\left(\frac1{s-\rho}+\frac1\rho\right).\]
	However, by using the above estimates, we see
	\[\frac{\Xi'(s)}{\Xi(s)}=\frac1s-\frac1{1-s}-\frac12\log\pi+\frac12\frac{\Gamma'(s/2)}{\Gamma(s/2)}+\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\]
	by definition of $\xi$. Now, the term $\zeta'/\zeta$ is well-behaved for $\op{Re}s$ large: we set $s\coloneqq2+it$, and one can see that $|\zeta'(s)/\zeta(s)|$ is bounded by an absolute constant. Thus, we understand on the right-hand side here.

	Continuing, we see
	\[\op{Re}\left(\frac1{s-\rho}+\frac1\rho\right)=\frac{2-\op{Im}s}{(2-\op{IRe}s)^2+(T-\op{Im}s)^2}+\frac\beta{(\op{Re}s+\op{Im}s)^2}\gg\frac1{1+|T-\op{Im}s|^2}.\]
	However, $\Gamma'(s)/\Gamma(s)\ll\log(T+3)$ by Stirling, so the result follows.
\end{proof}
