% F and F' are transverse; F^(-1)(F'(N')) is embedded submanifold?

% u(2) =/= su(2) x u(1)
% inversion is smooth but not multiplication
% how to check a lie group is compact

% intuition for jacobi identity

% compact manifold has a smooth vector field vanishing at large number of points? (hw did to finite number of points) [not compact?]

% tensors in the "functional view" a la 11-4

% slow vector field -> complete?
% why does thm 9.35 need V tangent to del M?
