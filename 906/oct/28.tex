\section{October 28}
Today, we will continue discussing spectra.

\subsection{Spectra}
We can generalize our notion of group-like $\mathbb E_\infty$-spaces being thought of as infinite loop spaces.
\begin{definition}[spectrum]
	A \textit{spectrum} is a sequence $(X_0,X_1,\ldots)$ of pointed spaces along with equivalences $X_i\to\Omega X_{i+1}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	A morphism $X\to Y$ of spectra is a morphism $X_i\to Y_i$ of the underlying pointed spaces, along with homotopies of the equivalences $X_i\to\Omega X_{i+1}$. Diagrammatically, we are providing vertical arrows in the diagram

	\[\begin{tikzcd}[cramped]
		{X_0} & {\Omega X_1} & {\Omega^2X_2} & \cdots \\
		{Y_0} & {\Omega Y_1} & {\Omega^2 Y_2} & \cdots
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]

		\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
		\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
		\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	along with ``square homotopies'' in each of the given squares.
\end{remark}
\begin{example} \label{ex:e-inf-is-spectra}
	Any group-like $\mathbb E_\infty$-space produces a spectrum.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	As an instance of \Cref{ex:e-inf-is-spectra}, we recall that a discrete abelian group $A$ gives rise to the spectrum
	\[A=\Omega K(A,1)=\Omega^2K(A,2)=\cdots.\]
	In fact, \Cref{ex:discrete-abelian-group-as-e-inf} shows that this is already an $\mathbb E_\infty$-space.
\end{example}
\begin{example} \label{ex:space-to-spec}
	Given a space $X$, we may follow \Cref{ex:space-to-e-inf} to construct a group-like $\mathbb E_\infty$-space $\Sigma^\infty X$ from a pointed space $X$. Indeed, we define $\Sigma^\infty X$ as the colimit
	\[X\to\Omega\Sigma X\to\Omega^2\Sigma^2X\to\cdots,\]
	where the internal maps arise from the adjunction of $\Omega$ and $\Sigma$. Namely, we define $X_0$ as the above colimit, and $X_i$ in general is the colimit of $\Sigma^iX\to\Omega\Sigma^{i+1}X\to\Omega^2\Sigma^{i+2}X\to\cdots$. It follows that $X_i=\Omega X_{i+1}$ because $\Omega=\op{Mor}\left(S^1,-\right)$ preserves filtered colimits (because $S^1$ is a compact object).
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	As an instance of \Cref{ex:space-to-spec}, we note that $\Delta^0=\Omega\Delta^0$, so $\Delta^0$ is a spectrum. We may call this the ``zero'' spectrum $0$ because it is both initial and terminal. (Indeed, $\Delta^0$ is already initial and terminal in pointed spaces.)
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	The functor $\Sigma^\infty\colon\mathrm{Spaces}_*\to\mathrm{Specta}$ admits a right adjoint $\Omega^\infty$ defined by $\Omega^\infty X\coloneqq X_0$. Approximately speaking, $\Omega^\infty$ should be thought of as a forgetful functor removing all ``higher'' information.
\end{remark}
Here is a nontrivial example.
\begin{theorem}[Bott periodicity] \label{thm:bott-periodicity}
	Let $\op U$ be the infinite unitary group, which is the colimit of the finite unitary groups. It turns out that $\Omega(B{\op U}\times\ZZ)\simeq\op U$ and $\Omega U\simeq B\op U\times\ZZ$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}
	There is a spectrum $KU\coloneqq(B{\op U}\times\ZZ,{\op U},B{\op U}\times\ZZ,{\op U},\ldots)$.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	It is not a joke that both spectra and $\mathbb E_\infty$-spaces should be thought of as analogous to abelian groups. For a taste of how this works, we know that the Dold--Kan correspondence (\Cref{thm:dold-kan}) explains that the category of simplicial abelian groups is equivalent to the derived $\infty$-category of chain complexes supported in nonnegative degrees, so one can more or less view $\mathbb E_\infty$ as analogous this derived category. Then spectra are analogous to allowing chain complexes in all integral degrees.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Stability}
The $\infty$-category of spectra will turn out to have many nice properties. The most important of these is stability, which we now explain.
\begin{notation}
	Let $\mc C$ be an $\infty$-category with a $0$ object and finite limits. Then we define the functor $\Omega_{\mc C}\colon\mc C\to\mc C$ by sending an object $x\in\mc C$ to the limit of the following diagram.
	% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMyxbMSwwLCIwIl0sWzAsMSwiMCJdLFsxLDEsIngiXSxbMSwyXSxbMCwyXV0=&macro_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FdFoiler%2Fnotes%2Fmaster%2Fnir.tex
	\[\begin{tikzcd}[cramped]
		& 0 \\
		0 & x
		\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
		\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	If there is no risk of confusion, will abbreviate $\Omega_{\mc C}$ to $\Omega$.
\end{notation}
\begin{example} \label{ex:spectra-is-stable}
	The category of spectra has $\Omega$ arise from the usual loops: it sends $(X_0,X_1,X_2,\ldots)$ to $(\Omega X_0,X_0,X_1,\ldots)$. In fact, we see that $\Omega$ is an auto-equivalence on spectra. The inverse functor is given by
	\[(X_0,X_1,\ldots)\mapsto(X_1,X_2,\ldots)\]
	because $X_0=\Omega X_1$. The point is that a spectrum can always be recovered from its ``higher'' terms.
\end{example}
\begin{definition}[stable]
	Let $\mc C$ be an $\infty$-category with a $0$ object and finite limits. Then we say that $\mc C$ is \textit{stable} if and only if $\Omega_{\mc C}$ is an equivalence. In this situation, we may write $\Sigma_{\mc C}$ for the inverse equivalence, which we will abbreviate to $\Sigma$ whenever possible.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	Consider the derived category $\mc D(\ZZ)$ of chain complexes of abelian groups. It turns out that $\Omega$ shifts a chain complex to the right by $1$, so $\Omega$ is an auto-equivalence.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	In \Cref{ex:spectra-is-stable}, we checked that the category of spectra is stable. However, the corresponding functor $\Sigma$ is not the usual suspension of pointed spaces.
\end{remark}
The following result explains why stability is a nice notion.
\begin{proposition} \label{prop:stability-is-good}
	Fix a stable $\infty$-category $\mc C$.
	\begin{listalph}
		\item The $\infty$-category $\mc C$ admits finite colimits.
		\item The functor $\Sigma$ sends an object $x$ to the colimit of the diagram $0\from c\to 0$.
		\item A square in $\mc C$ is a pullback if and only if it is a pushout.
	\end{listalph}
\end{proposition}
\begin{remark}
	One should think of (c) as analogous to the result for additive categories that products and coproducts of two objects exist and are the same.
\end{remark}
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:use-stability}
	Fix a stable $\infty$-category $\mc C$. Let $\mc P\subseteq\underline{\op{Hom}}\left(\Delta^1\times\Delta^1,\mc C\right)$ be the full subcategory of pullback squares. Then the forgetful functor $\mc P\to\underline{\op{Hom}}(\Lambda^2_0,\mc C)$ is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We exhibit an inverse ``up to loops.'' Namely, given some object $C\from A\to B$ in $\underline{\op{Hom}}(\Lambda^2_0,\mc C)$, we construct $F$, $G$, and $X$ to fit into the diagram
	% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMTMsWzIsMywiQyJdLFsyLDIsIkEiXSxbMywyLCJCIl0sWzEsMywiMCJdLFszLDEsIjAiXSxbMiwxLCJGIl0sWzEsMiwiRyJdLFsxLDEsIlgiXSxbMSwwLCJcXE9tZWdhIEMiXSxbMiwwLCIwIl0sWzAsMSwiXFxPbWVnYSBCIl0sWzAsMiwiMCJdLFswLDAsIlxcT21lZ2EgQSJdLFs3LDZdLFs2LDNdLFs2LDFdLFszLDBdLFsxLDBdLFs3LDVdLFs1LDFdLFs1LDRdLFs0LDJdLFsxLDJdLFs4LDldLFs4LDddLFsxMCw3XSxbMTAsMTFdLFsxMSw2XSxbOSw1XSxbMTIsOF0sWzEyLDEwXV0=&macro_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FdFoiler%2Fnotes%2Fmaster%2Fnir.tex
	\[\begin{tikzcd}[cramped]
		{\Omega A} & {\Omega C} & 0 \\
		{\Omega B} & X & F & 0 \\
		0 & G & A & B \\
		& 0 & C
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
		\arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
		\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]

		\arrow[from=3-3, to=3-4]
		\arrow[from=3-3, to=4-3]
		\arrow[from=4-2, to=4-3]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	where all squares are pullback squares (and as usual should be filled in with homotopies). Thus, we have functorially constructed $X$ is the pullback of the maps $\Omega C\from\Omega A\to\Omega B$.

	Now, let $\varphi\colon\mc P\to\underline{\op{Hom}}(\Lambda^2_0,\mc C)$ be the forgetful functor, and let $\psi\colon\underline{\op{Hom}}(\Lambda^2_0,\mc C)$ be the functor described in the previous paragraph. A quick calculation (and the uniqueness of pullbacks) shows that both composites $\varphi\circ\psi$ and $\psi\circ\varphi$ amount to taking $\Omega$ everywhere. Because $\mc C$ is stable, $\Omega$ admits an inverse, so we are done!
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:stability-is-good}]
	This is a repeated application of \Cref{lem:use-stability}. For example, to exhibit finite colimits, it is enough to exhibit pushouts of two elements (because we already have a $0$ object). Well, given some diagram $C\from A\to B$, we see that maps to some test object $T$ are equivalent to maps of diagrams to $T=T=T$. The equivalence of \Cref{lem:use-stability} then provides us with an object $D$ fitting into a pullback square
	% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJBIl0sWzEsMCwiQiJdLFswLDEsIkMiXSxbMSwxLCJEIl0sWzAsMV0sWzEsM10sWzIsM10sWzAsMl1d&macro_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FdFoiler%2Fnotes%2Fmaster%2Fnir.tex
	\[\begin{tikzcd}[cramped]
		A & B \\
		C & D
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
		\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
		\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	so that maps from this square to the square given by $T$ are the same as maps from $C\from A\to B$ to $T$. We conclude that $D$ is the pushout, which (a) follows.
	
	Continuing, the above argument implies that the pushout of the diagram $0\from\Omega D\to0$ is just $D$, so (b) follows. Lastly, to show (c), we note that we have already shown that pushout squares are pullback squares by their construction. Conversely, a pullback square can forget about its lower-right corner, and then one can re-remember the lower-right corner is the pushout via the preceding paragraph. This shows that pullback squares are pushout squares.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	One can unwind the proof of \Cref{lem:use-stability} to show that property (c) is equivalent to the stability of $\mc C$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Stable Homotopy Groups}
Here is our main definition.
\begin{definition}[stable homotopy]
	Fix a spectrum $X$ and an integer $i\in\ZZ$. Then we define the \textit{$n$th stable homotopy group} $\pi_i^{\mathrm{st}}(X)$ as
	\[\pi_i^{\mathrm{st}}(X)\coloneqq\pi_{i+j}X_j,\]
	provided that $i+j\ge0$. Whenever possible, we will abbreviate $\pi_i^{\mathrm{st}}(X)$ to $\pi_iX$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Note that the definition is independent of the choice of $i$ and $j$ because $\Omega X_{j+1}=X_{j}$, so $\pi_{i-1}X_{j+1}=\pi_{i-1}\Omega X_j=\pi_iX_j$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	A spectrum $X$ arises from a group-like $\mathbb E_\infty$-space if and only if $\pi_nX=0$ for all $n<0$ because this means that $X_i$ is $i$-connected for each $i$ (namely, $\pi_jX_i=0$ for $j<i$), so one can use \Cref{thm:may-recog} to recover $\mathbb E_\infty$-space structure.
\end{remark}
As with pointed spaces, we have a Whitehead's theorem.
\begin{theorem}[Whitehead for spectra] \label{thm:whitehead-spectra}
	Fix a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ of spectra. Then $f$ is an equivalence if and only if $\pi_if\colon\pi_iX\to\pi_iY$ is an isomorphism for all $i\in\ZZ$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	This immediately reduces to Whitehead's theorem for pointed spaces upon unwinding the definition of a morphism of spectra.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	If $X$ and $Y$ are in fact group-like $\mathbb E_\infty$-spectra, then one knows that $\pi_iX=\pi_iY$ for $i<0$, so checking the conclusion of \Cref{thm:whitehead-spectra} only requires $i\ge0$.
\end{remark}
As with homotopy groups, we may hope for a long exact sequence.
\begin{definition}[fiber sequence]
	Fix a stable $\infty$-category $\mc C$. Then a sequence $F\to E\to B$ is a \textit{fiber sequence} if and only if
	% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJGIl0sWzEsMCwiRSJdLFsxLDEsIkIiXSxbMCwxLCIwIl0sWzAsMV0sWzEsMl0sWzMsMl0sWzAsM11d&macro_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FdFoiler%2Fnotes%2Fmaster%2Fnir.tex
	\[\begin{tikzcd}[cramped]
		F & E \\
		0 & B
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
		\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
		\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	is a pullback square. We may also call this a \textit{cofiber sequence}.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	We may identify the notions of fiber sequences and cofiber sequences because of \Cref{prop:stability-is-good}.
\end{remark}
\begin{theorem}
	Fix a fiber sequence $F\to E\to B$ of spectra. Then there is a long exact sequence of stable homotopy groups
	\[\cdots\to\pi_{i+1}B\to\pi_iF\to\pi_iE\to\pi_iB\to\pi_{i-1}F\to\cdots.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The same proof as in spaces shows that a fiber sequence $F\to E\to B$ gives rise to a fiber sequence $\Omega B\to F\to E$. Because $\Omega$ is now an auto-equivalence, we also receive a fiber sequence $E\to B\to\Sigma F$. Thus, we can see that it really amounts to checking exactness at $\pi_0$, which amounts to noting that $\Omega^\infty$ preserves limits (because it is a right adjoint) so that the fiber sequence $F\to E\to B$ of spectra goes to a fiber sequence $F_0\to E_0\to B_0$ of spaces. We now may apply the homotopy long exact sequence for pointed spaces.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	Here is an amusing application: if $F\to E\to B$ is a cofiber sequence of pointed spaces, then $\Sigma^\infty F\to\Sigma^\infty E\to\Sigma^\infty B$ continues to be a cofiber sequence ($\Sigma^\infty$ preserves colimits because it is a left adjoint), so we get a long exact sequence of stable homotopy groups
	\[\cdots\to\pi_{i+1}^{\mathrm{st}}B\to\pi_i^{\mathrm{st}}F\to\pi_i^{\mathrm{st}}E\to\pi_i^{\mathrm{st}}B\to\pi_{i-1}^{\mathrm{st}}F\to\cdots.\]
	This is purely a statement about pointed spaces!
\end{remark}
