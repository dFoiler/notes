% localization of noncommutative rings?
% can all ideals appear as Ann M?
% reference for support of tensor product of fin gen mods?
% Hilbert polynomial at negative indices?
% geometric view of Jacobson radical?

% is there a module over a non-noetherian ring with no associated primes?
% geometric view of idempotent splitting R = Re x R(1-e)
