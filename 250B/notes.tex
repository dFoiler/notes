% quote for later chapter: "To deal with a 14-dimensional space, visualize a 3-D space and say 'fourteen' to yourself very loudly. Everyone does it."

% localization of noncommutative rings?
% can all ideals appear as Ann M?
% reference for support of tensor product of fin gen mods?
% Hilbert polynomial at negative indices?
% geometric view of Jacobson radical?

% is there a module over a non-noetherian ring with no associated primes?
% geometric view of idempotent splitting R = Re x R(1-e)

% notion for galois theory for integral extensions?
% doing linear algebra in noncommutative rings?

% when does the irrelevant ideal-adic filtration equal the graded filtration?

% does the Krull topology on the completion communicate with the Zariski topology

% non-noetherian rings with trivial dimension
% dimension in the noncommutative case?
% connection between completion and localization?
