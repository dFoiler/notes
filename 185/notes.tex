% until "The exponential function II"

% "Integration" from "Paths" to "Consequences of Cauchy Integral Formula II"
% might use "How strange to actually have to see the path of your journey in order to make it." from Scythe for the Paths section
% not sure how to organize the rest of this ...

% the definition of "bounded near" seems off? f(z) = 1/sqrt(z) is bounded near 0?

% do we need to know about differentiation of power series?
% does "knowing the theorem statements" merely mean knowing the the theorem statements? what does knowing "continuous on compact implies uniformly continuous" mean?
% should we be expected to be able to give proofs of the listed theorems?
% should it be obvious that C--R is sufficient?

% compactification
% manifolds and branch cuts
