% until "The exponential function II"

% "Integration" from "Paths" to "Consequences of Cauchy Integral Formula II"
% might use "How strange to actually have to see the path of your journey in order to make it." from Scythe for the Paths section
% not sure how to organize the rest of this ...

% the definition of "bounded near" seems off? f(z) = 1/sqrt(z) is bounded near 0?
