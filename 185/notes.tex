% until "The exponential function II"

% "Integration" from "Paths" to "Consequences of Cauchy Integral Formula II"
% might use "How strange to actually have to see the path of your journey in order to make it." from Scythe for the Paths section
% not sure how to organize the rest of this ...

% the definition of "bounded near" seems off? f(z) = 1/sqrt(z) is bounded near 0?

% do we need to know about differentiation of power series?
% does "knowing the theorem statements" merely mean knowing the the theorem statements? what does knowing "continuous on compact implies uniformly continuous" mean?
% should we be expected to be able to give proofs of the listed theorems?
% should it be obvious that C--R is sufficient?

% compactification
% manifolds and branch cuts

% this analytic check for exp seems *really* annoying

% copy and pasted proofs of inverse derivatives and chain rule---surely there is a more general framework we are accessing?
% conformal map theorem shouldn't need args?
% conformal when things are equal to 0?
% does preserving right angles impoly preserving all angles?

% rigorize changing order of summation?
% why is the Cauchy--Goursat theorem so hard?

% sharpen entire has dense image
% something about zeta with arbitrary approximation
% entire equals power series

% argument principle if we go where there is a zero
% the uniform thing, citing Miles
% brag about diagrams
% homotopy things from residue theorem?
