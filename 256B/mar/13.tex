\section{March 13}

Term paper topics have been posted. We began class by completing the proof of \Cref{thm:proj-cohom}. I have edited directly into those notes for continuity.

\subsection{Cohomology of Projective Varieties}
As an application of our computation, we have the following result.
\begin{theorem}[Serre]
	Suppose $X$ is a proper variety over a Noetherian ring $A$, and suppose we have a very ample sheaf $\OO_X(1)$. Further, let $\mc F$ be a coherent sheaf on $X$.
	\begin{listalph}
		\item The $A$-modules $H^i(X,\mc F)$ are finitely generated over $A$.
		\item We have $H^i\left(X,\mc F\otimes\OO_X(1)^n\right)=0$ for $n$ sufficiently large (depending on $\mc F$).
	\end{listalph}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Because $X$ is proper, the locally closed embedding arising from the very ample sheaf is actually a closed embedding $\iota\colon X\to\PP^r_A$ (by taking the base-change of the structure morphism). Then we can compute
	\[H^i(X,\mc F)=H^i(\PP^r_A,\iota_*\mc F).\]
	Thus, we can replace $X$ with $\PP^r_A$ without tears. To continue, we pick up the following lemma.
	\begin{lemma}
		Let $\mc F$ be a coherent sheaf on $\PP^r_A$. Then we can find some $\mc E=\bigoplus_{i=0}^k\OO(n_i)$ with a surjection $\mc E\to\mc F$.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		This is \cite[Corollary~II.5.18]{hartshorne}.
	\end{proof}
	As such, to show the result, we have an exact sequence
	\[0\to\mc R\to\mc E\to\mc F\to0.\]
	This gives the exact sequence
	\[H^i(X,\mc E)\to H^i(X,\mc F)\to H^{i+1}(X,\mc R).\]
	The statements (a) and (b) are certainly true for $i$ large enough because everything vanishes. As such, we can apply descending induction on $i$, where we know that the left and right terms are finite (the left by the previous computation and the right by our induction), so we conclude that the middle term is also finite.

	For (b), we can check the statements are true for $\mc E$ by our previous computation: upon high enough twisting, we see that $H^i(X,\OO(n))$ vanishes on our projective space, so $\mc E$ on upon high enough twisting will also have vanishing cohomology. As such, we see that $H^i(X,\mc F(n))\to H^{i+1}(X,\mc R(n))$ is an injection for $n$ large enough by our exactness, but our descending induction gives us vanishing for $n$ large enough, which is what we wanted.
\end{proof}
As another application, we will be able to give a cohomological criterion for a sheaf to ample.
\begin{theorem}
	Fix a proper scheme $X$ over a Noetherian ring $A$. For any line bundle $\mc L$, then $\mc L$ is ample if and only if each quasicoherent sheaf $\mc F$ has $H^i\left(X,\mc F\otimes\mc L^n\right)=0$ for $i>0$, for any $n$ sufficiently large.
\end{theorem}
We will show this next class.
