\subsection{Jacobi Criterion}
Let's provide a relative way to check smoothness.
\begin{proposition}[Jacobi criterion]
	Let $j\colon X\to Z$ be a closed embedding of $S$-schemes locally of finite presentation, where $Z$ is smooth over $S$ of relative dimension $n$. Further, let $\mc I\subseteq\OO_Z$ be the corresponding sheaf of ideals. Fixing $x\in X$ and $z\coloneqq j(x)$, the following are equivalent.
	\begin{listalph}
		\item $X$ is smooth over $S$ at $x$ of relative dimension $r$.
		\item The canonical exact sequence
		\[0\to\mc I/\mc I^2\to j^*\Omega_{Z/S}\to\Omega_{X/S}\to0\]
		is split-exact at $x$, and $r=\op{rank}_{\OO_{X,x}}(\Omega_{X/S})_x$.
		\item Given a basis $dz_1,\ldots,d_n$ of $(\Omega_{Z/S})_z$, and if $g_1,\ldots,g_N$ are sections of $\OO_Z$ generating $\mc I_Z\subseteq\OO_S$, then there is a relabeling of $z_1,\ldots,z_n,g_1\ldots,g_N$ such that $\mc I_Z$ is generated by $g_{r+1},\ldots,g_n$ and $dz_1,\ldots,dz_n,dg_1,\ldots,dg_r$ generating $(\Omega_{Z/S})_z$.
		\item There are local sections $g_{r+1},\ldots,g_n$ of $\OO_{Z,z}$ generating $\mc I_z$ such that $dg_{r+1}(z),\ldots,dg_n(z)$ are linearly independent in $\Omega_{Z/S}\otimes k(z)$.
	\end{listalph}
\end{proposition}
Note that (d) is the definition of being smooth when $Z$ is affine space.
\begin{proof}
	We showed that (a) implies (b) in our argument that (a) implies (b) in \Cref{thm:formal-smooth}, except the locally free with desired rank was shown in \Cref{prop:smooth-tangent-ses}.

	For (b) implies (c), we need some more commutative algebra.
	\begin{lemma}
		Let $(A,\mf m)$ be a local ring with finite free $A$-module $F$. A minimal generating set for $F$ is a free basis.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		This is by Nakayama's lemma. Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be a minimal generating set for $F$, which provides us with a surjection $\pi\colon A^n\to F$. Then $\overline x_1,\ldots,\overline x_n$ spans $F/\mf mF$, but any linear dependence means that we can decrease the number of generators, meaning that we can generate $F$ by fewer generators than in $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ by Nakayama's lemma. Thus, $\overline x_1,\ldots,\overline x_n$ is in fact a basis of $F/\mf mF$.

		To finish the proof, we note that $\ker\pi\subseteq\mf mA^n$ is forced, but because $F$ is free and hence projective, we see that
		\[A^n\cong\ker\pi\oplus F,\]
		so $\mf mA^n=\mf m\ker\pi\oplus\mf mF$, so $\ker\pi=\mf m\ker\pi$ follows, so $\ker\pi=0$ by Nakayama's lemma.
	\end{proof}
	Thus, (b) to (c) follows by making explicit the split-exactness.\todo{What?} There is nothing to say for (c) implies (d) by checking locally and noting that generating enforces linear independence.

	For (d) implies (a), embed $Z$ into some $\AA^N_S$ by the ideal $\mc J$, generated by the elements $f_{n+1},\ldots,f_N$ such that
	\[df_{n+1}(z),\ldots,df_N(z)\]
	are linearly independent in $\Omega_{\AA^N_S/S}\otimes k(z)$; here we are using the smoothness of $Z$. Now, $X$ will be cut out in $\AA^N_S$ by the elements
	\[g_{r+1},\ldots,g_n,f_{n+1},\ldots,f_N\]
	at $x$. For $X$ to be smooth at $x$, we would like to show that the above sections have the needed linear independence after taking differential. Well, we see that
	\[(\Omega_{\AA^N_S/S})_z\cong(\mc J/\mc J^2)_z\oplus(\Omega_{Z/S})_z\]
	by the local splitting of our exact sequence. Taking fibers over $z$, we note that $df_{n+1}(z),\ldots,df_N(z)$ are linearly independent in $\mc J/\mc J^2\otimes k(z)$, and so because the $dg_\bullet(z)$ are generating $\Omega_{Z/S}\otimes k(z)$, a dimension computation shows that they are linearly independent.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	I think the above result implies that the smooth locus is open, for example using the split-exactness of the local short exact sequence.
\end{remark}
