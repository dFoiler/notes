\subsection{Jacobi Criterion}
Let's provide a relative way to check smoothness.
\begin{proposition}[Jacobi criterion]
	Let $j\colon X\to Z$ be a closed embedding of $S$-schemes locally of finite presentation, where $Z$ is smooth over $S$ of relative dimension $n$. Further, let $\mc I\subseteq\OO_Z$ be the corresponding sheaf of ideals. Fixing $x\in X$ and $z\coloneqq j(x)$, the following are equivalent.
	\begin{listalph}
		\item $X$ is smooth over $S$ at $x$ of relative dimension $r$.
		\item The canonical exact sequence
		\[0\to\mc I/\mc I^2\to j^*\Omega_{Z/S}\to\Omega_{X/S}\to0\]
		is split-exact at $x$, and $r=\op{rank}_{\OO_{X,x}}(\Omega_{X/S})_x$.
		\item Given a basis $dz_1,\ldots,d_n$ of $(\Omega_{Z/S})_z$, and if $g_1,\ldots,g_N$ are sections of $\OO_Z$ generating $\mc I_Z\subseteq\OO_S$, then there is a relabeling of $z_1,\ldots,z_n,g_1\ldots,g_N$ such that $\mc I_Z$ is generated by $g_{r+1},\ldots,g_n$ and $dz_1,\ldots,dz_n,dg_1,\ldots,dg_r$ generating $(\Omega_{Z/S})_z$.
		\item There are local sections $g_{r+1},\ldots,g_n$ of $\OO_{Z,z}$ generating $\mc I_z$ such that $dg_{r+1}(z),\ldots,dg_n(z)$ are linearly independent in $\Omega_{Z/S}\otimes k(z)$.
	\end{listalph}
\end{proposition}
Note that (d) is the definition of being smooth when $Z$ is affine space.
\begin{proof}
	We showed that (a) implies (b) in our argument that (a) implies (b) in \Cref{thm:formal-smooth}, except the locally free with desired rank was shown in \Cref{prop:smooth-tangent-ses}.

	For (b) implies (c), we need some more commutative algebra.
	\begin{lemma}
		Let $(A,\mf m)$ be a local ring with finite free $A$-module $F$. A minimal generating set for $F$ is a free basis.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		This is by Nakayama's lemma. Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be a minimal generating set for $F$, which provides us with a surjection $\pi\colon A^n\to F$. Then $\overline x_1,\ldots,\overline x_n$ spans $F/\mf mF$, but any linear dependence means that we can decrease the number of generators, meaning that we can generate $F$ by fewer generators than in $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ by Nakayama's lemma. Thus, $\overline x_1,\ldots,\overline x_n$ is in fact a basis of $F/\mf mF$.

		To finish the proof, we note that $\ker\pi\subseteq\mf mA^n$ is forced, but because $F$ is free and hence projective, we see that
		\[A^n\cong\ker\pi\oplus F,\]
		so $\mf mA^n=\mf m\ker\pi\oplus\mf mF$, so $\ker\pi=\mf m\ker\pi$ follows, so $\ker\pi=0$ by Nakayama's lemma.
	\end{proof}
	Thus, (b) to (c) follows by making explicit the split-exactness.\todo{What?} There is nothing to say for (c) implies (d) by checking locally and noting that generating enforces linear independence.

	For (d) implies (a), embed $Z$ into some $\AA^N_S$ by the ideal $\mc J$, generated by the elements $f_{n+1},\ldots,f_N$ such that
	\[df_{n+1}(z),\ldots,df_N(z)\]
	are linearly independent in $\Omega_{\AA^N_S/S}\otimes k(z)$; here we are using the smoothness of $Z$. Now, $X$ will be cut out in $\AA^N_S$ by the elements
	\[g_{r+1},\ldots,g_n,f_{n+1},\ldots,f_N\]
	at $x$. For $X$ to be smooth at $x$, we would like to show that the above sections have the needed linear independence after taking differential. Well, we see that
	\[(\Omega_{\AA^N_S/S})_z\cong(\mc J/\mc J^2)_z\oplus(\Omega_{Z/S})_z\]
	by the local splitting of our exact sequence. Taking fibers over $z$, we note that $df_{n+1}(z),\ldots,df_N(z)$ are linearly independent in $\mc J/\mc J^2\otimes k(z)$, and so because the $dg_\bullet(z)$ are generating $\Omega_{Z/S}\otimes k(z)$, a dimension computation shows that they are linearly independent.
\end{proof}
Let's get some utility out of this.
\begin{proposition}
	Fix a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ of $S$-schemes. Further, fix $x\in X$ and $y\coloneqq f(x)$ where $X$ is smooth over $S$ at $x$, and $Y$ is smooth over $S$ at $y$. Then the following are equivalent.
	\begin{listalph}
		\item $f$ is smooth at $x$.
		\item The map $(f^*\Omega_{Y/S})_x\to(\Omega_{X/S})_x$ is an isomorphism onto a direct factor.
		\item The map $f^*\Omega_{Y/S}\otimes k(x)\to\Omega_{X/S}\otimes k(x)$ is injective (on the fiber).
	\end{listalph}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Here we go.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We show (a) implies (b). This follows from noting that
		\[0\to f^*\Omega_{Y/S}\to\Omega_{X/S}\to\Omega_{X/Y}\to0\]
		will be split-exact at $x$ because $f$ is smooth at $x$, as we showed in the argument on Monday.
		\item Note (b) implies (c) by Nakayama's lemma.
		\item We show (c) implies (a). Note we may embed $Y\to\AA^s_S$ using the smoothness of $Y$ at $y$, whereupon we might as well set $Y=\AA^s_S$. As such, $f$ is really determined by the global sections $\overline f_1,\ldots,\overline f_s\in\Gamma(X,\OO_X)$. Because $X$ is smooth of relative dimension $r$, we are granted an embedding $X\into\AA^m_S$ whose ideal sheaf is generated by the sections $h_{r+1},\ldots,h_m\in\OO_{\AA^m_S}$ such that
		\[dh_{r+1}(x),\ldots,dh_m(x)\]
		are linearly independent in $\Omega_{\AA^n_S/S}\otimes k(x)$. Now, consider the composite
		\[X\into X\times_SY\into\AA^m_S\times\AA^s_S=\AA^{m+s}_S=\AA^m_Y.\]
		Now, lift the sections $\overline f_\bullet$ to sections of the affine space $f_\bullet\in\OO_{\AA^m_S}$.

		Continuing, everything can be checked affine-locally, so set $S=\Spec R$ and $X=\Spec A$, where $X=R[X_1,\ldots,X_m]/(h_{r+1},\ldots,h_m)$. Writing $Y=\AA^s_S=\Spec R[T_1,\ldots,T_s]$, we see that our composite is given by
		\[R[X_1,\ldots,X_m,T_1,\ldots,T_s]\onto A[T_1,\ldots,T_s]\onto A,\]
		where the last map sends $T_\bullet\mapsto\overline f_\bullet$. Thus, $X$ is a closed subscheme of $\AA^m_Y$ cut out by $T_1-f_1,\ldots,T_s-f_s,h_{r+1},\ldots,h_m$. These sections are going to provide our smoothness.

		For example, the elements $dT_i(y)$ are linearly independent in $\Omega_{Y/S}\otimes k(y)$ because $Y$ is affine over $S$. Using the hypothesis, we see that
		\[f^*\Omega_{Y/S}\otimes k(x)=(\Omega_{Y/S}\otimes k(y))\otimes_{k(y)}k(x)\to\Omega_{X/S}\otimes k(x)\]
		is an injection, so the sections $df(dT_i)(x)$ continue to be linearly independent in $\Omega_{X/S}\otimes k(x)$.

		On the other hand, let $\mc J$ be the ideal sheaf for $X\into\AA^m_S$. We have a split-exact sequence
		\[0\to(\mc I/\mc I^2)_x\to(\Omega_{\AA^m/S}|_X)_x\to(\Omega_{X/S})_x\to0.\]
		By base-change, we see that $p\colon Y\to S$ has $p^*\Omega_{\AA^m_S/S}=\Omega_{\AA^m_Y/Y}$, so the sections $dh_{r+1}(x),\ldots,dh_n(x)$ are linearly independent in $\Omega_{\AA^m_S/S}\otimes k(x)$. Now, the split-exactness, we conclude that
		\[\Omega_{\AA^m_S/S}\otimes k(x)=(\mc I/\mc I^2\otimes k(x))\oplus(\Omega_{X/S}\oplus k(x)),\]
		so all our sections together continue to be linearly independent.
		\qedhere
