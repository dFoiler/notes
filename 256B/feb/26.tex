We began class completing the proof of \Cref{thm:cohom-proj-space}, for which I have edited the notes of last class for continuity reasons.

\subsection{Cohomology on Projective Schemes}
We now use \Cref{thm:cohom-proj-space} for fun and profit.
\begin{theorem}
	Fix a Noetherian ring $A$ and projective $A$-scheme $X$. Further, fix a very ample line bundle $\OO_X(1)$ on $X$ and coherent sheaf $\mc F$ on $X$.
	\begin{listalph}
		\item $H^i(X,\mc F)$ is a finitely generated $A$-modules for all $i>0$.
		\item There exists an integer $n_0$ such that $H^i(X,\mc F(n))=0$ for $n>n_0$ and $i>0$.
	\end{listalph}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We proceed in steps.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We reduce to $X=\PP^r_A$ for some $r>0$. Indeed, fix some closed embedding $j\colon X\to\PP^r_A$ for some $r>0$ such that $\OO_X(1)=j^*\OO_{\PP^r_A}(1)$. Then $H^i(X,\mc F(n))=H^i(\PP^r_A,j_*(\mc F(n)))$ by \Cref{lem:closed-cohomology}; now, everything around is Noetherian and separated, so $j_*\mc F$ is coherent on $\PP^r_A$, so (a) will indeed follow from knowing the result for $\PP^r_A$. Further,
		\[j_*(\mc F(n))=j_*(\mc F\otimes\OO_X(n))=j_*\mc F\otimes j_*j^*\OO_{\PP^r_A}(n)=(j_*\mc F)(n),\]
		where $\stackrel*=$ is by the projection formula \cite[Exercise~II.5.1]{hartshorne}. Thus, (b) will also follow from the result for $\PP^r_A$.
	\end{enumerate}
	We will complete this proof next class.
\end{proof}
