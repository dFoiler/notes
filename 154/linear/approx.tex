\section{Diophantine Approximation}
% louiville and transcendental numbers
% roth's theorem, maybe thue's theorem (proof?)
% finiteness results for diophantine equations
% irrationality measure; everything has irrationality measure 2
% not sure if that's two lectures or three
% flint hill series things?
% transcendence of e
% continued fraction expansion of e

Now that we have some experience with finding good rational approximations to real numbers, we are able to more firmly step foot into the field of Diophantine approximation.
