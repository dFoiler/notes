% exercise 1.56
% where is the cohomology in L1.71?
% sheaf theory things without elements
% compatible germs from category theory
% sheaf on a base but from stalks

% stalks of the direct image sheaf

% flasque sheaves play the role of injective modules in cohomology
% noetherian stalks means locally noetherian scheme?
