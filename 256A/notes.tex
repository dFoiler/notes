% TODO
% Example 1.135 (surjectivity not on opens but stalks)
% P1.160 exactness at stalks
% S1.5.10 (constant sheaf, skyscraper sheaf, adjuction)
% S2.2.2 (gluing schemes)
% S2.2.3 (gluing for projective space)
% S2.2.7 (proj structure sheaf)
% Example 2.73 (P^n_k is irred)
% NEx 2.77 (Spec Zs is not quasicompact)
% show open embeddings exist
% example: Spec C -> Spec C as R-varieties is not determined by what it does on closed points

% where is the cohomology in L1.71?
% sheaf theory things without elements
% compatible germs from category theory
% sheaf on a base but from stalks

% stalks of the direct image sheaf

% flasque sheaves play the role of injective modules in cohomology
% noetherian stalks means locally noetherian scheme?

% normalization as completion
% intuition for finiteness adjectives
% why "quasiseparated"?

% is it ever illuminating to work with locally ringed spaces instead of schemes?
% do locally ringed spaces have fiber products?
% how scared should I be of gluing?
% closed map of topological spaces => integral morphism?
% functors from ring to Scheme such as A and P?
% is being separated a purely topological condition?
