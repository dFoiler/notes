\section{September 21}

Today we return to fiber products and discuss some applications.

\subsection{Representability}
We start with a few definitions.
\begin{definition}[Zariski sheaf]
	A functor $F\colon\mathrm{Sch}\opp\to\mathrm{Set}$ is a \textit{Zariski sheaf} if and only if $F$ is a sheaf when the scheme is viewed as merely a topological space. Namely, each scheme $T$ has
	\[0\to F(T)\to\prod_iF(T_i)\to\prod_{i,j}F(T_i\cap T_j)\]
	exact for any open cover $\{T_i\}$ of $T$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Open subfunctor]
	Fix functors $F,F'\colon\mathrm{Sch}\opp\to\mathrm{Set}$. Then $F'\subseteq F$ is an \textit{open subfunctor} if and only if each scheme $T$, every natural transformation $\psi\colon h_T\Rightarrow F$ yielding a pullback square

	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		{F_{i,\psi}} & {h_T} \\
		{F_i} & F
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
		\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
		\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
		\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
		\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	already has each $F_{i,\psi}$ represented by a scheme $T_i$ with the natural transformation $F_{i,\psi}\into h_T$ given by an open embedding $T_i\into T$.
\end{definition}
Here is an abstract lemma.
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:abstract-repr}
	A functor $F\colon\mathrm{Sch}\opp\to\mathrm{Set}$ is representable if and only if the following conditions are satisfied.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $F$ is a Zariski sheaf.
		\item Locally representable: there are representable subfunctors $F_i\subseteq F$ for each $i$, and $F_i\subseteq F$ is an open subfunctor such that $\{F_i\}$ covers $F$. Here, covering means that each field $K$ has $F(\Spec K)=\bigcup_iF_i(\Spec K)$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
The point is that each $F_i$ is represented by some $X_i$, and we just want to glue these $X_i$ together. This is the idea of the proof.
\begin{remark}
	One can replace $\mathrm{Sch}\opp$ with $\mathrm{Ring}$ or $\mathrm{Sch}_S\opp$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	One can show that \autoref{lem:abstract-repr} implies that the fiber product exists. Namely, the fiber product forms a Zariski sheaf, which we can see from the part where we glued to make $W$ in the key case. Then the $F_i$ come from the purely affine case, which was comparatively easier. Lastly, the $F_i$ cover $F$ roughly speaking comes from the rest of the proof.
\end{remark}
We will not need \autoref{lem:abstract-repr} for the time being.

\subsection{Fibers}
As a first application, we discuss fibers. Given a scheme morphism $\varphi\colon Y\to S$, we might be interested in the fibers here to pull-back. Namely, pulling back to a ``subscheme'' $X$ of $S$, we can imagine the fibers of $Y$ over $X$ as the fiber product, as in the following diagram.
% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJYXFx0aW1lc19TWSJdLFsxLDAsIlkiXSxbMSwxLCJTIl0sWzAsMSwiWCJdLFswLDFdLFswLDNdLFszLDJdLFsxLDJdLFswLDIsIiIsMSx7InN0eWxlIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJjb3JuZXIifX1dXQ==&macro_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FdFoiler%2Fnotes%2Fmaster%2Fnir.tex
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{X\times_SY} & Y \\
	X & S
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
For example, in the case of $Y=\Spec k[x,y,z]/\left(y^2-x(x-1)(x-s)\right)$ and $S=\Spec k[s]$, we see that we have the obvious map $Y\to S$ sending $x,y\mapsto0$.

Now, if we want to understand the fiber at a given point $s_0\in S$ with $s_0\in k$ for concreteness, the corresponding scheme is a $\Spec k$ over $\Spec S$ induced by the map $k[s]\to k$ by $s\mapsto s_0$. Then we can track our fibers in this affine case as given by

\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{Y\otimes_{k[s]}\Spec k} & Y \\
	{\Spec k} & {\Spec k[s]}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
where we can compute directly from commutative algebra that
\[Y\otimes_{k[s]}\Spec k\simeq\Spec\frac{k[x,y]}{\left(y^2-x(x-1)(x-s_0)\right)}\]
here.

As such, we are convinced that the following is a good definition of a fiber.
\begin{definition}[Fiber]
	Fix a scheme $Y$ over a scheme $S$. Given a point $s_0\in S$, the fiber product $Y\times_S\{s_0\}$ is the \textit{fiber} of $Y\to S$ over $s_0$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	If $X\into S$ is a closed embedding, then $Y\times_SX\into Y$ is a closed embedding as well. In particular, if $s_0\in S$ is a closed point, then our fiber is in fact a closed embedding. More generally, if $S$ is irreducible with generic point $\eta$, we call $Y\times_S\{\eta\}$ the generic fiber.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	Notably, we can check purely topologically that the fiber defined by the fiber product is the correct fiber at a point.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Base Extension}
We again begin with a special case. Take $S=\Spec K$ to be our base and $X=\Spec K'$ where $K'/K$ is a field extension; the embedding $K\into K'$ induces a map $X\to S$.

Now, if we have a scheme $Y$ over $S$, we might want to pull $Y$ back to a scheme over $X$, where we are applying some base-change operation. To do this, we unsurprisingly want the fiber product, as in the following diagram.
% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJYXFx0aW1lc19TWSJdLFsxLDAsIlkiXSxbMSwxLCJTIl0sWzAsMSwiWCJdLFswLDFdLFswLDNdLFszLDJdLFsxLDJdLFswLDIsIiIsMSx7InN0eWxlIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJjb3JuZXIifX1dXQ==&macro_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FdFoiler%2Fnotes%2Fmaster%2Fnir.tex
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{X\times_SY} & Y \\
	X & S
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
As an example, if we have $Y=\Spec K[x,y]/\left(y^2-x^3+x\right)$, we can compute that
\[X\times_SY=\Spec\frac{K'[x,y]}{\left(y^2-x^3+x\right)},\]
which agrees with our intuition of what base-change should do.
\begin{example}
	As another quick example, we can compute $\PP^n_K\times_{\Spec K}\Spec K'=\PP^n_{K'}$. For example, we could cleanly define projective $n$-space over a scheme $S$
	\[\PP^n_S=\PP^n_{\Spec\ZZ}\times_{\Spec\ZZ}S\]
\end{example}
This notation is a bit cumbersome, so we will abbreviate it.
\begin{notation}
	Fix a morphism $S'\to S$. If $X$ is a scheme over $S$, we might denote the base-change of $X$ to a scheme over $S'$ as $X_{S'}=X\times_SS'$.
\end{notation}
\begin{remark}
	Given a field extension $K'/K$ and a scheme $X$ over $\Spec K$, we can check that $X_{K'}(K')=X(K')$. This is purely formal: a morphism $\Spec K'\to X$ induces a unique morphism $\Spec K'\to X_{K'}$ making the diagram

	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		{\Spec K'} \\
		& {X_{K'}} & X \\
		& {\Spec K'} & {\Spec K}
		\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]

	\end{tikzcd}\]
	commute. Notably, we are using the identity map $\Spec K'\to\Spec K'$ because $X(K')$ consists of the $K$-morphisms $\Spec K'\to X$.
\end{remark}
In applications, the base-change to the algebraic closure will be especially important because certain aspects become clear only once passing to an algebraic closure. This gives the following definition.
\begin{defihelper}[Goemetrically irreducible, reduced, connected] \nirindex{Geometrically irreducible} \nirindex{Geometrically reduced} \nirindex{Geometrically connected}
	A scheme $X$ over a field $K$ is \textit{geometrically irreducible/reduced/connected} if and only if $X_{\overline K}$ is irreducible/reduced/connected.
\end{defihelper}
\begin{example}
	Fix the scheme $X=\Spec\QQ(\sqrt2)$ over the scheme $\Spec\QQ$. Even though $X$ is irreducible, it is not geometrically irreducible because $X_{\overline\QQ}$ becomes two copies of $\Spec\overline\QQ$. Indeed,
	\[X_{\overline\QQ}=\Spec(\QQ(\sqrt2)\otimes_\QQ\overline\QQ)=\Spec(\overline\QQ\times\overline\QQ)=\Spec\overline\QQ\sqcup\Spec\overline\QQ.\]
	Namely, $\QQ(\sqrt2)\otimes_\QQ\overline\QQ\cong\overline\QQ\times\overline\QQ$ by decomposing some element $(a+b\sqrt2)\otimes\alpha$ as $1\otimes a\alpha+\sqrt2\otimes b\alpha$.
\end{example}
Intuitively, being irreducible but not geometrically irreducible means that passing to the algebraic closure gives rise to Galois conjugate pieces. This allows us to separate geometric information from Galois information.

\subsection{The Relative Frobenius}
For concreteness, fix a scheme $S$ over $\FF_p$. Notably, a scheme $X$ over $S$ has a map $X\to S$, so because the sheaf $p\OO_S$ vanishes, we have that $p\OO_X$ will also vanish. The point is that the $p$th-power map $f\mapsto f^p$ is going to induce a scheme morphism $F_X\colon X\to X$.

To see morphism topologically, let's see an example. When $X=\Spec A$ is affine, we see that $A$ is an $\mathbb F_p$-algebra, and the Frobenius mapping $\varphi\colon a\mapsto a^p$ we can see directly sends $\mf p$ by $\varphi^{-1}$ to itself. Thus, the Frobenius is indeed nothing at all topologically.
\begin{remark}
	The above morphism is called the absolute Frobenius.
\end{remark}

Now, we have another Frobenius morphism $F_S\colon S\to S$, and we can see that the diagram

\[\begin{tikzcd}
	X & X \\
	S & S
	\arrow["{F_X}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{F_S}", from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
commutes. However, the fiber product now promises us a morphism $X\to X\times_SS$, where the two $S$s are different copies with a Frobenius morphism going between them.
\begin{remark}
	The above morphism is called the relative Frobenius.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
	With $S=\Spec\FF_p[s]$ and $X=\Spec\FF_p[s,x]$, the relative Frobenius keeps $s$ fixed and sends $x\mapsto x^p$.
