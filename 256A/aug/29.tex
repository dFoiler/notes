Today we talk about the structure sheaf. To review, so far we have defined the spectrum $\Spec A$ of a ring $A$ and given it a topology. The goal for today is to define its structure sheaf. Here is a motivating example.
\begin{example}
	Set $A\coloneqq\CC[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ so that $\Spec A=\AA^n_k$. Recall that $\{D(f)\}_{f\in A}$ is a base for the Zariski topology, and we would like the functions on this ring to be $A_f$, the rational polynomials which allow some $f$ in the denominator. In other words, these are rational functions on $\CC^n$ whose poles are allowed on $V(\{f\})$ only.
\end{example}

\subsection{Sheaves}
Sheaves are largely a topological object, so we will forget that we are interested in the Zariski topology for now. Throughout, $X$ will be a topological space.
\begin{notation}
	Given a topological space $X$, we let $\op{Op}X$ denote the poset (category) of its open sets.
\end{notation}
Namely, the objects of $\op{Ob}X$ are open sets, and
\[\op{Mor}(V,U)=\begin{cases}
	\{*\} & V\subseteq U, \\
	\emp & \text{else}.
\end{cases}\]
Here is our definition.
\begin{definition}[Presheaf]
	A \textit{presheaf} $\mathcal F$ on a topological space $X$ valued in a category $\mathcal C$ is a contravariant functor $\mathcal F\colon(\op{Ob}X)\opp\to\mathcal C$. More concretely, $\mathcal F$ has the following data.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Given an open set $U\subseteq X$, we have $\mathcal F(U)\in\mathcal C$.
		\item Given open sets $V\subseteq U\subseteq X$, we have a restriction map ${\op{res}_{U,V}}\colon\mathcal F(U)\to\mathcal F(V)$ in $\mathcal C$.
	\end{itemize}
	This data satisfies the following coherence conditions.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identity: given an open set $U\subseteq X$, ${\op{res}_{U,U}}=\id_{\mathcal F(U)}$.
		\item Functoriality: given open sets $W\subseteq V\subseteq U$, the following diagram commutes.

			\arrow["{\op{res}_{V,W}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
			\arrow["{\op{res}_{U,W}}"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
		\end{tikzcd}\]
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{notation}
	We might call an element $f\in\mc F(U)$ a \textit{section over $U$}.
\end{notation}
\begin{notation}
	Given $f\in\mathcal F(U)$, we might write $f|_V\coloneqq\op{res}_{U,V}f.$
\end{notation}
\begin{remark}
	In principle, one can have any target category $\mathcal C$ for our presheaf. However, we will only work $\mathrm{Set}$, $\mathrm{Ab}$, $\mathrm{Ring}$, $\mathrm{Mod}_R$ in this class. In particular, we will readily assume that $\mc C$ is a concrete category.
\end{remark}
Now that we've defined an algebraic object, we should discuss its morphisms.
\begin{definition}[Presheaf morphism]
	Fix a topological space $X$. A \textit{presheaf morphism} between $\mathcal F$ and $\mathcal G$ is a natural transformation $\eta\colon\mathcal F\Rightarrow\mathcal G$. In other words, for each open set $U\subseteq X$, we have a morphism $\eta_U\colon\mathcal F(U)\to\mathcal F(V)$; these morphisms make the following diagram commute.

		\arrow["{\op{res}_{U,V}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{definition}
We've talked about presheaves a lot; where are sheaves?
\begin{definition}[Sheaf]
	Fix a topological space $X$. A presheaf $\mathcal F\colon(\op{Ob}X)\opp\to\mathcal C$ is a \textit{sheaf} if and only if it satisfies the following for any open set $U\subseteq X$ with an open cover $\mc U$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identity: if $f_1,f_2\in\mc F(U)$ have $f_1|_V=f_2|_V$ for all $V\in\mc U$, then $f_1=f_2$.
		\item Gluability: if we have $f_V\in\mc F(V)$ for all $V\in\mc U$ such that
		\[f_{V_1}|_{V_1\cap V_2}=f_{V_2}|_{V_1\cap V_2}\]
		for all $V_1,V_2\in\mc U$, then there is $f\in\mc F(U)$ such that $f|_V=f_V$ for all $V\in\mc U$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Sheaves of functions will be our key example here. Intuitively, any type of function which can be determined ``locally'' will form a sheaf; for example, here are continuous functions.
\begin{exe} \label{exe:sheafex}
	Fix topological spaces $X$ and $Y$. For each $U\subseteq X$, let $\mc F(U)$ denote the set of continuous functions $f\colon U\to Y$, and equip these sets with the natural restriction maps. Then $\mc F$ is a sheaf.
\end{exe}
\begin{proof}
	To begin, here are the functoriality checks.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identity: for any $f\in\mc F(U)$, we have $f|_U=f$.
		\item Functoriality: if $W\subseteq V\subseteq U$, any $f\in\mc F(U)$ will have $(f|_V|_W)(w)=f(w)=(f|_W)(w)$ for any $w\in W$, so $f|_V|_W=f|_W$ follows.
	\end{itemize}
	Here are sheaf checks. Fix an open cover $\mc U$ of an open set $U\subseteq X$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identity: suppose $f_1,f_2\in\mc U$ have $f_1|_V=f_2|_V$ for all $V\in\mc U$. Now, for all $x\in U$, we see $x\in U_x$ for some $U_x\in\mc U$, so
		\[f_1(x)=(f_1|_{U_x})(x)=(f_2|_{U_x})(x)=f_2(x),\]
		so $f_1=f_2$ follows.
		\item Gluability: suppose we have $f_V\in\mc F(V)$ for each $V\in\mc U$ such that $f_{V_1}|_{V_1\cap V_2}=f_{V_2}|_{V_1\cap V_2}$ for each $V_1,V_2\in\mc U$. Now, for each $x\in\mc U$, find $U_x\in\mc U$ with $x\in U_x$ and set
		\[f(x)\coloneqq f_{U_x}(x).\]
		Note this is well-defined: if $x\in U_x$ and $x\in U_{x'}$, then $f_{U_x}(x)=f_{U_x}|_{U_x\cap U_x'}(x)=f_{U_x'}|_{U_x\cap U_x'}(x)=f_{U_x'}(x)$. Additionally, we see that, for each $V\in\mc U$ and $x\in V$, we have
		\[f|_V(x)=f(x)=f_V(x)\]
		by construction, so we are done.

		Lastly, we need to check that $f$ is continuous. Well, for any open set $V_0\subseteq Y$, we can compute
		\[f^{-1}(V_0)=\{x\in U:f(x)\in V_0\}=\bigcup_{V\in\mc U}\{x\in V:f(x)\in V_0\}=\bigcup_{V\in\mc U}\{x\in V:f_V(x)\in V_0\}=\bigcup_{V\in\mc U}f_V^{-1}(V_0),\]
		which is open as the arbitrary union of open sets because $f_V\colon V\to Y$ is a continuous function.
		\qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
In contrast, sheaves have trouble keeping track of ``global'' information.
\begin{example}
	For each $U\subseteq\RR$, let $\mc F(\RR)$ denote the set of bounded continuous functions $f\colon\RR\to\RR$, and equip these sets with the natural restriction maps. Then $\mc F$ is not a sheaf: for each open set $(n-1,n+1)$ for $n\in\NN$, the function $f_{(n-1,n+1)}\coloneqq\id_{(n-1,n=1)}$ is bounded and continuous, but the glued function $f=\id_\RR$ is not bounded on all of $\RR$. (We glued using \autoref{exe:sheafex}, which does force the definition of $f$.)
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	For most of our examples, the identity axiom is easily satisfied: intuitively, the identity axiom says that two sections are equal if and only if they agree locally. However, gluability is usually the tricky one: it requires us to build a function from local behavior.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	Note that the section $f\in\mc F(U)$ promised by the gluability axiom is unique by the identity axiom.
\end{remark}
Ok, so we've defined the sheaf as an algebraic object, so here are its morphisms.
\begin{definition}[Sheaf morphism]
	A \textit{sheaf morphism} is a morphism of the (underlying) presheaves.
\end{definition}
As an aside, we note that we can succinctly write the sheaf conditions in an exact sequence.
\begin{lemma}
	Fix a topological space $X$ and presheaf $\mc F\colon(\op{Ob}X)\opp\to\mathcal C$, where $\mathcal C$ is an abelian category or $\mathrm{Grp}$. Then $\mc F$ is a sheaf if and only if the sequence
	\begin{equation}
		\arraycolsep=1.4pt\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
			0 &\to& \mc F(U) &\to& \displaystyle\prod_{V\in\mc U}\mc F(V) &\to& \displaystyle\prod_{V_1,V_2\in\mc U}\mc F(V_1\cap V_2) \\
			  &   & f        &\mapsto& (f|_V)_{V\in\mc U} \\
			  &   &          &       & (f_V)_{V\in\mc U} &\mapsto& (f_{V_1}|_{V_1\cap V_2}-f_{V_2}|_{V_1\cap V_2})_{V_1,V_2}
		\end{array} \label{eq:sheafles}
	\end{equation}
	is exact.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	In one direction, suppose that $\mc F$ is a sheaf, and we will show that \autoref{eq:sheafles} is exact for any open cover $\mc U$ of an open set $U$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Exact at $\mc F(U)$: suppose $f_1,f_2\in\mc F(U)$ have the same image in $\prod_{V\in\mc U}\mc F(V)$. This means that
		\[f_1|_V=f_2|_V\]
		for all $V\in\mc U$, so the identity axiom tells us that $f_1=f_2$.
		\item Exact at $\prod_{V\in\mc U}\mc F(V)$: of course any $f\in\mc F(U)$ goes to $(f|_V)_{V\in\mc U}$, which goes to
		\[f|_{V_1}|_{V_1\cap V_2}-f|_{V_2}|_{V_1\cap V_2}=f|_{V_1\cap V_2}-f|_{V_1\cap V_2}=0\in\prod_{V_1,V_2\in\mc U}\mc F(V_1\cap V_2)\]
		and therefore lives in the kernel. Conversely, suppose $(f_V)_{V\in\mc U}$ vanishes in $\prod_{V_1,V_2}\mc F(V_1\cap V_2)$. Rearranging, this means that
		\[f_{V_1}|_{V_1\cap V_2}=f_{V_2}|_{V_1\cap V_2},\]
		so the gluability axiom tells us that we can find $f\in\mc F(U)$ such that $f|_V=f_V$. This finishes.
	\end{itemize}
	Conversely, suppose that $\mc F$ makes \autoref{eq:sheafles} always exact, and we will show that $\mc F$ is a sheaf. Fix an open cover $\mc U$ of an open set $U$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identity: suppose that $f_1,f_2\in\mc F(U)$ have $f_1|_V=f_2|_V$ for any $V\in\mc U$. This means that $f_1$ and $f_2$ have the same image in $\prod_{V\in\mc U}\mc F(V)$, so the exactness of \autoref{eq:sheafles} at $\mc F(U)$ enforces $f_1=f_2$.
		\item Gluability: suppose that we have $f_V\in\mc F(V)$ for each $V\in\mc U$ in such a way that $f_{V_1}|_{V_1\cap V_2}=f_{V_2}|_{V_1\cap V_2}$ for all $V_1,V_2\in\mc U$. Then the image of $(f_V)_{V\in\mc U}$ in $\prod_{V_1,V_2\in\mc U}\mc F(V_1\cap V_2)$ is
		\[(f_{V_1}|_{V_1\cap V_2}-f_{V_2}|_{V_1\cap V_2})_{V_1,V_2}=(0)_{V_1,V_2},\]
		so exactness of \autoref{eq:sheafles} forces there to be $f\in\mc F(U)$ such that $f|_V=f_V$ for each $V\in\mc U$. This finishes.
		\qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	One might want to continue this left-exact sequence. To see this, we will have to talk about cohomology, which is a task for later in life.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Sheaf on a Base}
In light of our sheaf language, we are trying to define a ``structure'' sheaf $\mc O_{\Spec A}$ on $\Spec A$, and we wanted to have
\[\mc O_{\Spec A}(D(f))=A_f.\]
We aren't going to be able to specify a presheaf with this data, but we can specify a sheaf. In some sense, the presheaf is unable to build up locally in the way that a sheaf can, so having the data on a base like $\{D(f)\}_{f\in A}$ need not be sufficient to define the full presheaf.

But as alluded to, we can do this for sheaves. We begin by defining a sheaf on a base.
\begin{definition}[Sheaf on a base]
	Fix a topological space $X$ and a base $\mc B$ for its topology. Then a \textit{sheaf on a base valued in $\mc C$} is a contravariant functor $F\colon\mc B\opp\to\mathcal C$ satisfying the following identity and gluability axioms: for any $B\in\mc B$ with a basic cover $\{B_i\}_{i\in I}$, we have the following.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identity: if we have $f_1,f_2\in F(B)$ such that $f_1|_{B_i}=f_2|_{B_i}$ for all $B_i$, then $f_1=f_2$.
		\item Gluability: if we have $f_i\in F(B_i)$ for each $i$ such that $f_i|_{B}=f_j|_{B}$ for each $B\subseteq B_i\cap B_j$, then there is $f\in F(B)$ such that $f|_{B_i}=f_i$ for each $i$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	Given a topological space $X$ and a base $\mc B$, any sheaf $\mc F\colon(\op{Op}X)\opp\to\mathcal C$ ``restricts'' to a sheaf on a base $\mc F_\mc B$ by setting $\mc F_\mc B(B)\coloneqq\mc F(B)$ for all $B\in\mc B$ and reusing the same restriction maps. The identity and gluability axioms follow from their (stronger) sheaf counterparts; checking this amounts writing down the axioms.
\end{example}
Morphisms are constructed in the obvious way.
\begin{definition}[Sheaf on a base morphisms]
	Fix a topological space $X$ and a base $\mc B$ for its topology. Then a \textit{morphism} between two sheaves $F$ and $G$ on the base $\mc B$ is a natural transformation of the (underlying) contravariant functors.
\end{definition}
\begin{ex}
	Given a topological space $X$ and a base $\mc B$, any sheaf morphism $\eta\colon\mc F\to\mc G$ restricts in the obvious way to a morphism $\eta_\mc B\colon\mc F_\mc B\to\mc G_\mc B$ (namely, $(\eta_\mc B)_B=\eta_B$) on the corresponding sheaves on a base. Checking this amounts to saying out loud that the diagram on the left commutes for any $B'\subseteq B$ because it is the same as the diagram on the right.

\end{ex}
We are interested in showing that we can build a sheaf from a sheaf on a base uniquely, but it will turn out to be fruitful to spend a moment to discuss how this behaves on morphisms first for the uniqueness part of this statement.
\begin{lemma}
	Fix a topological space $X$ with a base $\mc B$ for its topology. Given shaves $\mc F$ and $\mc G$ on $X$ with values in $\mc C$ and a morphism of the (underlying) sheaves on a base $\eta_\mc B\colon\mc F_\mc B\to\mc G_\mc B$, there is a unique sheaf morphism $\eta\colon\mc F\to\mc G$ such that $(\eta_\mc B)_B=\eta_B$ for each $B\in\mc B$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We show uniqueness before existence.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Uniqueness: fix any open $U\subseteq X$, and we will try to solve for $\eta_U\colon\mc F(U)\to\mc G(U)$. Well, fix a basic open cover $\mc U$ of $U$; then, for any $B\in\mc U$, we need the following diagram to commute.
		% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJcXG1jIEYoVSkiXSxbMSwwLCJcXG1jIEcoVSkiXSxbMCwxLCJcXG1jIEYoQikiXSxbMSwxLCJcXG1jIEcoQikiXSxbMiwzLCJcXGV0YV9CPShcXGV0YV9cXG1jIEIpX0IiLDJdLFswLDEsIlxcZXRhX1UiXSxbMCwyLCJcXG9we3Jlc31fe1UsQn0iLDJdLFsxLDMsIlxcb3B7cmVzfV97VSxCfSJdXQ==&macro_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FdFoiler%2Fnotes%2Fmaster%2Fnir.tex
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			{\mc F(U)} & {\mc G(U)} \\
			{\mc F(B)} & {\mc G(B)}
			\arrow["{\eta_B=(\eta_\mc B)_B}"', from=2-1, to=2-2]
			\arrow["{\eta_U}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
			\arrow["{\op{res}_{U,B}}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
			\arrow["{\op{res}_{U,B}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		In particular, for any $f\in\mc F(U)$, we need $\eta_U(f)|_B=(\eta_\mc B)_B(f|_B)$. Thus, $\eta_U(f)|_B$ is fully specified by the data provided by $\eta_\mc B$, so the identity axiom for $\mc G$ forces $\eta_U(f)$ to be unique.
		\item Existence: to begin, fix any open $U\subseteq X$, and we will define $\eta_U\colon\mc F(U)\to\mc G(U)$. As alluded to above, we let $\mc U$ be the set of basis elements which are contained in $U$ so that $\mc U$ is a (large) basic cover of $U$.
		
		Then, picking up $f\in\mc F(U)$, we will try to use the gluability axiom by setting $g_B\coloneqq(\eta_\mc B)_B(f|_B)$ for each $B\in\mc U$. In particular, for any $B,B'\in\mc U$, any basic $B_0\subseteq B\cap B'$ has
		\[(g_B|_{B\cap B'})|_{B_0}=g_B|_{B_0}=(\eta_\mc B)_B(f|_B)|_{B_0}=(\eta_{\mc B})_{B_0}(f|_B|_{B_0})=\eta_{B_0}(f|_{B_0})=g_{B_0},\]
		which is also $(g_{B'}|_{B\cap B'})_{B_0}$ by symmetry, so the identity axiom applied to $B\cap B'$ implies $g_B|_{B\cap B'}=g_{B'}|_{B\cap B'}$. Thus, the gluability axiom applied to $U$ gives us a unique $g\in\mc G(U)$ such that
		\[g|_B=(\eta_\mc B)_B(f|_B)\]
		for each basic set $B\subseteq U$. We define $\eta_U(f)\coloneqq g$.

		It remains to show that $\eta$ does in fact assemble into a sheaf morphism. Fix open sets $V\subseteq U$, and we need the following diagram to commute.
		% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJcXG1jIEYoVSkiXSxbMSwwLCJcXG1jIEcoVSkiXSxbMCwxLCJcXG1jIEYoVikiXSxbMSwxLCJcXG1jIEcoVikiXSxbMiwzLCJcXGV0YV9WIiwyXSxbMCwxLCJcXGV0YV9VIl0sWzAsMiwiXFxvcHtyZXN9X3tVLFZ9IiwyXSxbMSwzLCJcXG9we3Jlc31fe1UsVn0iXV0=&macro_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FdFoiler%2Fnotes%2Fmaster%2Fnir.tex

			\arrow["{\op{res}_{U,V}}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
			\arrow["{\op{res}_{U,V}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		Well, pick up any $f\in\mc F(U)$. Then, for any basic $B\subseteq V\subseteq U$, we see that
		\[\eta_U(f)|_B=(\eta_\mc B)_B(f|_B)=(\eta_\mc B)_B(f|_V|_B),\]
		so the uniqueness of $\eta_V(f|_V)$ forces $\eta_V(f|_V)=\eta_U(f)|_U$. This finishes.
		\qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
Finally, here is our result.
\begin{proposition} \label{prop:sheaffrombase}
	Fix a topological space $X$ with a base $\mc B$ for its topology. Given a sheaf on a base $F\colon\mc B\opp\to\mc C$, there is a sheaf $\mc F$ and isomorphism (of sheaves on a base) $\iota\colon F\to\mc F_B$ satisfying the following universal property: any sheaf $\mc G$ with a morphism (of sheaves on a base) $\varphi\colon F\to\mc G_\mc B$ has a unique sheaf morphism $\psi\colon\mc F\to\mc G$ making the following diagram commute.

		\arrow["\psi_\mc B", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	We will provide the construction of $\mc F(U)$ for an open set $U\subseteq X$ as
	\[\mc F(U)=\limit_{B\subseteq U}F(B).\]
	More concretely, $\mc F(U)$ is made of a large tuple $(f_B)_{B\in\mc B}$ such that $B'\subseteq B$ implies $f_B|_{B'}=f_{B'}$. We will not check that this satisfies the constraints.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	One can also define $\mc F(U)$ as compatible systems of stalks, but we have not defined stalks yet.

\subsection{Affine Schemes (Finally!)}
We are now ready to define the structure sheaf.  We use \autoref{prop:sheaffrombase}. Note that $D(f)\subseteq D(g)$ implies $V(g)\subseteq V(f)$, so $I(V(g))\supseteq I(V(f))$, so $f\in\rad g$, so $f^n=ag$ for some positive integer $n$. This implies that $g$ is a unit in $A_g$, so there is a natural restriction map
\[\op{res}_{D(g),D(f)}\colon A_g\to A_f.\]
That we have a presheaf on a base is then routine to check.

It remains to check our coherence properties. Fix an open cover
\[D(f)=\bigcup_{i\in\mc I}D(f_i),\]
which implies using the previous argument that $f_j^{n_j}=c_jf$ for some positive integer $n_j$ and element $c_j\in A$, and in fact $f^n$ for some large $n$ is in the ideal generated by the $f_j$; one can check that this is equivalent. Now here are our checks.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identity: we may assume that $\mc I$ is finite because the equivalent condition at the end allows us to remove all but finitely many of the $f_i$.

	Now, for identity, it suffices to pick up $s\in D(f)$ with $s|_{D(f_i)}=0$ (in $A_{f_i}$) for all $f_i$, and we want to show $s=0$. Namely, we know $f_i^{n_i}s=0$ (in $A_f$) for some $n_i$ everywhere. However, as stated above, we may write
	\[f^n=\sum_{i\in\mc I}a_if_i,\]
	and then taking this equation to a very large power and multiplying through by $s$ forces $f^ns=0$.
	\item Gluability: we will check this next time.
\end{itemize}
The above data then assembles into our structure sheaf.
