\section{September 23}
Today we continue talking about vector fields.

\subsection{Vector Fields on Lie Groups}
Let's return to Lie groups.
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:left-invariant-by-germ}
	Fix a regular Lie group $G$. A vector field $\xi$ on $G$ is left-invariant if and only if
	\[\xi(f\circ L_g)=\xi f\circ L_g\]
	for any germ $f$ defined in a neighborhood of $g$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We show the two implications separately.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $\xi$ is left-invariant, then $\xi_{gh}=(dL_g)_h(\xi_h)$ for any $g,h\in G$. Thus, for any $h\in G$, we see that
		\begin{align*}
			(\xi f\circ L_g)(h) &= \xi_{gh}f \\
			&= ((dL_g)_h\xi_h)f \\
			&= \xi_h(f\circ L_g),
		\end{align*}
		as required.
		\item Suppose $\xi(f\circ L_g)=\xi f\circ L_g$ for any $f$. Then plugging in the identity tells us that
		\[\xi_gf=(\xi f\circ L_g)(e)=\xi_e(f\circ L_g)=((dL_g)_e(\xi_e))(f).\]
		Thus, $\xi_g=(dL_g)_e\xi_e$, as required.
		\qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:vector-field-lie-group-action}
	Fix a left-invariant vector field $\xi$ on a regular Lie group $G$. Then for a germ $f$ at a point $g\in G$, one has
	\[\xi_g f=\frac d{dt}f(g\exp(t\xi_e))\bigg|_{t=0}.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	This is more or less the chain rule. For our $g\in G$, \Cref{lem:left-invariant-by-germ} tells us that
	\[\xi_gf=\xi_e(f\circ L_g).\]
	Now, the path $\gamma\colon\FF\to G$ given by $\gamma(t)\coloneqq\exp(t\xi_e)$ has $\gamma'(0)=\xi_e$, so
	\[\xi_e(f\circ L_g)=d(f\circ L_g\circ\gamma)'(0)=\frac d{dt}f(g\exp(t\xi_e))\bigg|_{t=0},\]
	as required.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
	Fix a regular Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mf g$. Then the collection of left-invariant vector fields $\op{Vect}^L(G)$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\op{Vect}(G)$ which is isomorphic to $\mf g$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	By \Cref{rem:lie-algebra-to-invariant}, one certainly has an isomorphism $\op{Vect}^L(G)\to\mf g$ given by $\xi\mapsto\xi_e$, with inverse given by $X\mapsto\xi_X$, where $\xi_X$ is the vector field $\xi_X(g)\coloneqq dL_g(X)$. Now, by \Cref{lem:left-invariant-by-germ}, $\xi$ is left-invariant if and only if
	\[\xi(f\circ L_g)=\xi f\circ L_g\]
	for any germ $f$ defined in a neighborhood of $g$. Thus, we see that $\op{Vect}^L(G)$ is preserved by the commutator of $\op{Vect}(G)$.
	
	It remains to check that our isomorphism with $\mf g$ is a morphism of Lie algebras. Fix $X,Y\in\mf g$, and we would like to show that $[\xi_X,\xi_Y]=\xi_{[X,Y]}$. It is enough to check this equality after mapping back down to $\mf g$, so we want to check that $[\xi_X,\xi_Y]_e=[X,Y]$. This is a direct computation: by \Cref{lem:vector-field-lie-group-action}, any germ $f$ at $e$ has
	\begin{align*}
		[\xi_X,\xi_Y]_ef &= \frac d{dt}\big(\xi_Yf(\exp(tX))-\xi_Xf(\exp(tY))\big)\bigg|_{t=0} \\
		&= \frac{\del^2}{\del s\del t}\frac d{ds}\big(f(\exp(tX)\exp(sY))-f(\exp(tY)\exp(sX))\big)\bigg|_{(s,t)=(0,0)} \\
		&= \frac{\del^2}{\del s\del t}\bigg(f\exp\left(tX+sY+\frac12st[X,Y]+\cdots\right)-f\exp\left(tX+sY-\frac12st[X,Y]+\cdots\right)\bigg)\bigg|_{(s,t)=(0,0)}.
	\end{align*}
	Now, one can imagine taking a Taylor series expansion of $f\circ\exp\colon\mf g\to\RR$ in terms of $Z$, in which we see that the above derivative will only depend on the $st$ term of the relevant expansion. More precisely, write $(f\circ\exp)(Z)=f(e)+\lambda(Z)+Q(Z)+C(Z)$, where $\lambda$ is linear, $Q$ is quadratic, and $C$ has vanishing first- and second-order derivatives. Then, after cancellation within $\lambda$, we see that
	\begin{align*}
		[\xi_X,\xi_Y]_ef &= \frac{\del^2}{\del s\del t}st\lambda(st[X,Y])\bigg|_{(s,t)=(0,0)} \\
		&\qquad+\frac{\del^2}{\del s\del t}Q\left(tX+sY+\frac12st[X,Y]+\cdots\right)\bigg|_{(s,t)=(0,0)} \\
		&\qquad+\frac{\del^2}{\del s\del t}Q\left(tX+sY-\frac12st[X,Y]+\cdots\right)+\cdots\bigg|_{(s,t)=(0,0)},
	\end{align*}
	where $+\cdots$ denotes higher-order terms which will not affect the current derivative (for example, containing $C$). Now, the linear terms inside $Q$ will produce cancelling terms after expansion, so the only term we are left to care about is
	\[[\xi_X,\xi_Y]_ef=\lambda([X,Y])=\frac d{dt}(f\circ\exp)(t[X,Y])\bigg|_{t=0}=(\xi_{[X,Y]})_ef,\]
	as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Group Actions via Lie Algebras}
In general, if $G$ acts on a regular manifold $M$ via the action $a\colon G\times X\to X$, one can define an action of $\mf g$ on $\op{Vect}(X)$ by analogy with \Cref{lem:vector-field-lie-group-action}.
\begin{definition}
	Fix a left action $a\colon G\times M\to M$ of a regular Lie group $G$ on a regular manifold $M$. Then we define $a_*\colon\mf g\to\op{Vect}(M)$ by
	\[(a_*X)_pf\coloneqq\frac d{dt}f(a(\exp(-tX),p))\bigg|_{t=0}\]
	for any $p\in M$ and germ $f$ at $p$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Let's explain the sign in the above definition: the action of $G$ on $M$ induces a natural action of $G$ on the regular functions $\OO(M)$ by $(g\cdot f)(p)\coloneqq f\left(g^{-1}\cdot p\right)$. It is this action of $G$ on $\OO(M)$ which motivates the above definition.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	On the homework, we will check that $a_*$ is a morphism of Lie algebras.
\end{remark}
We can now prove the Orbit--stabilizer theorem (\Cref{thm:orbit-stabilizer-lie-algebra}) in the following more precise form.
\begin{theorem}[Orbit--stabilizer] \label{thm:orbit-stabilizer-lie-algebra}
	Fix a left action $a\colon G\times M\to M$ of a regular Lie group $G$ on a regular manifold $M$. Fix some $p\in M$.
	\begin{listalph}
		\item For all $p\in M$, the stabilizer $G_p$ is a closed Lie subgroup with Lie algebra
		\[\op{Lie}G_p=\{X\in\mf g:(a_*X)_p=0\}.\]
		\item The induced map $G/G_p\to M$ given by $g\mapsto g\cdot p$ is an injective immersion. In particular, the orbit $Go$ is an immersed submanifold.
		\item If the induced map $G/G_p\to M$ is an embedding, then $G/G_p$ is diffeomorphic to $Gp$.
	\end{listalph}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We begin with the proof of (a), which we do in steps.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Set
		\[\mf g_p\coloneqq\{X\in\mf g:(a_*X)_p=0\}\]
		for brevity. We claim that $\mf g_p\subseteq\mf g$ is a Lie subalgebra. Certainly $X\mapsto (a_*X)_p$ is a linear map $\mf g\to\op{Vect}(M)\to T_pM$, so $\mf g_p$ is a linear subspace.
		
		It remains to check that $\mf g_p$ is preserved by the bracket. Fix $X,Y\in\mf g_p$, and we want to check $[X,Y]\in\mf g_p$. Well, because $a_*$ is a homomorphism of Lie algebras, we see
		\[a_*[X,Y]_pf=\underbrace{(a_*X)_p}_0(a_*Yf)-\underbrace{(a_*Y)_p}_0(a_*Xf)=0\]
		for any germ $f$ at $p$. Thus, $a_*[X,Y]=0$, so $[X,Y]\in\mf g_p$.

		\item For $X\in\mf g_p$, we check that $\exp(X)\in G_p$. Indeed, we claim the two curves $\gamma_1(t)\coloneqq \exp(-tX)\cdot p$ and $\gamma_2(t)\coloneqq p$ are both integral curves for $a_*X$ with the same initial condition at $0$. This completes the check because it implies that $\exp(X)\cdot p=\gamma_1(-1)=\gamma_2(-1)=p$ by uniqueness of integral curves.
		
		To prove the claim, we note that $\gamma_2$ is constant, so there is nothing to check there. For $\gamma_1$, we must check that
		\[\gamma_2'(t)\stackrel?=(a_*X)_{\gamma_2(t)}\]
		in $T_{\gamma_2(t)}M$. To check this, we pass through an arbitrary germ $f$ to see that
		\[\gamma_2'(t)f=(f\circ\gamma_2)'(t)=\frac d{ds}f(\exp(-sX-tX)\cdot p)\bigg|_{s=0},\]
		and
		\[(a_*X)_{\gamma_2(t)}f=\frac d{ds}f(\exp(-tX-sX)\cdot p)\bigg|_{s=0},\]
		as required.
		
		\item We attempt to control $\mf g/\mf g_p$. Choose a complement $\mf u$ of $\mf g_p\subseteq\mf g$ so that $\mf g=\mf g_p\oplus\mf u$. (We do not require that $\mf u$ is a Lie subalgebra, despite the font.) Then the map $f\colon\mf u\to T_pM$ given by $Z\mapsto(a_*Z)_p$ has kernel $\mf g_p\cap\mf u=0$ and hence is injective. Thus, the Implicit function theorem tells us that the map $F\colon\mf u\to M$ given by $v\mapsto\exp(-V)\cdot p$ must be an injective immersion for small $v$ because $df_p(V)=dF_p(V)$.
		
		Instead of using the Implicit function theorem, we can argue using local diffeomorphisms as follows: fix a basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_k\}$ of $\mf u$, and extend the linearly independent set $\{dF_p(e_1),\ldots,df_p(e_k)\}\subseteq T_pM$ to a basis $\{dF_p(e_1),\ldots,dF_p(e_k)\}\sqcup\{e_{k+1}',\ldots,e_m'\}$. Then define a local map $\widetilde F\colon\mf u\times\FF^{m-k}\to M$ by
		\[\widetilde F(a_1e_1+\cdots+a_me_m)=F(a_1e_1+\cdots+a_ke_k)+a_{k+1}e'_{k+1}+\cdots+a_me_m',\]
		where the addition on the right-hand side is defined in a local chart of $M$ around $p$. (Technically, $\widetilde F$ is only defined in a neighborhood of $0\in\mf u$.) Then $\widetilde F$ is a local diffeomorphism at $0$ by construction, so $F$ is an injective immersion in this same neighborhood of $0$.

		\item We construct a slice chart for $G_p\subseteq G$ at the identity, which will complete the proof (a) by \Cref{lem:one-slice-subgroup}. Note that the map $\exp^\oplus\colon\mf g_p\oplus\mf u\to G$ given by $(V,X)\mapsto\exp(V)\exp(X)$ is a local diffeomorphism at $0$ (because the differential is simply the identity by checking what happens on each piece $\mf g_p$ and $\mf u$ separately). Thus, for $g\in G$ sufficiently close to $e$, we can write $g$ uniquely as in the image of $e$ and thus as $g=\exp(V)\exp(X)$ where $V\in\mf u$ and $X\in\mf g_p$. Now, we see that $g\in G_p$ if and only if $\exp(V)\in G_p$, which for small enough $V$ is equivalent to $V\in\mf g_p$ by the previous step.

		In total, we have constructed a very small open neighborhood $U\subseteq\mf g_p\oplus\mf u$ of the identity such that $e|_U$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image $\exp^\oplus(U)\subseteq G$ and
		\[G_p\cap\exp^\oplus(U)=\{(V,X)\in\mf g_p\oplus\mf u:V=0\},\]
		which is a slice chart.

		% \item Now, one sees that $\mf u\times\mf g_p\to G$ given by the exponential is a local diffeomorphism. Thus, for a small open neighborhood $U$ of $G$, one finds that $g\in G_x$ can be written uniquely as $\exp(v)\exp(Z)$, so $g\in G_x$ if and only if $v=0$, which provides a slice chart. Thus, $G_p$ is an embedded submanifold with the described Lie subalgebra.
		
		% \item For any $Z\in\mf g_p$, we claim that $\exp(-tZ)p=p$ for all $t$. Indeed, both sides are integral curves for $Z$, so the uniqueness of integral curves completes the proof.
	\end{enumerate}
	We now proceed with (b). Let $\ov\varphi$ denote the induced map $G/G_p\to M$ given by $\ov\varphi(g)\coloneqq g\cdot p$, which we want to see is an injective immersion. Injectivity follows by definition of $G_p$: if $\varphi(g_1)=\varphi(g_2)$, then $g_1\cdot p=g_2\cdot p$, so $g_1^{-1}g_2\in G_p$, so $g_1G_p=g_2G_p$. Being an immersion more or less follows from the proof. By translation, it suffices to show that $d\ov\varphi_e$ is injective.\footnote{Once $d\ov\varphi_e$ is injective, we note that $\ov\varphi\circ L_g=L_g\circ\ov\varphi$ (where the first $L_g$ is a map $G\to G$ and the second is a map $M\to M$, but both are diffeomorphisms), so $d\ov\varphi_g\circ d(L_g)_e=d(L_g)_{p}\circ d\ov\varphi_e$ verifies that $d\ov\varphi_g$ is injective.} Well, the Lie algebra of $G/G_p$ is the quotient $\mf g/\mf g_p$ by \Cref{thm:quotient-group}, which is isomorphic to $\mf u$ by construction of $\mf u$. But we know that the action map is injective on $\mf u$ by the third step above, so we are done.

	Lastly, we note that (c) follows immediately from (b) because embeddings are diffeomorphic onto their images by the uniqueness of the smooth structure of embedded submanifolds.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark} \label{rem:isomorphism-theorem}
	We also remark that \Cref{thm:isomorphism} follows quickly from the above result. Indeed, let $G$ act on $H$ via the homomorphism $\varphi\colon G\to H$: $g\cdot h\coloneqq\varphi(g)h$. Then the stabilizer of any $h\in H$ is given by $\ker\varphi$, proving $\ker\varphi$ is in fact a closed Lie subgroup. Now, passing to $\ov\varphi$ as in the above proof shows that $G/\ker\varphi\to\im\varphi$ is an injective immersion.
